# Styleguide | Data Privacy Handbook

This is (a start of) the styleguide for the [Data Privacy Handbook](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook). 
If you'd like to contribute to the Handbook, please follow these guidelines, so we can keep the language, spelling, wording, etc. consistent across the Handbook.

## British spelling

We follow the Utrecht University guidelines, we use British English spelling. That means:

- Anonymisation, not anonymization
- Behavioural, not behavioral
- Travelling, not traveling

## Easy to understand language

It is important that the Handbook is easy to understand for researchers using it:

- Where possible and applicable, use active language. So not "a privacy scan should be performed", but "you should perform a privacy scan".
- Use concrete sentences and words. So not  "it takes a while", but "it takes between 1 and 3 months".
- Avoid legal terminology where possible. As privacy is quite a legal subject, this can be quite a challenge!
- Limit the length of sentences, preferably to under 25 words per sentence. Shorter sentences are easier to understand than really long ones. 

## Linking to other places

Where possible, we'd like to prevent overcrowding pages with information. If any information is already elsewhere, we link to it instead.
We distinguish between two types of links:

1. Links to other pages in the Handbook should be written as `[this is an internal link](#section-reference)`. 
You can find the section references in the .Rmd files in lines that start with `#` between the curly brackets: `{#name-of-reference}`.
2. Links to external pages should be written as `[this is an external link](https://a-url-here.com){target="_blank"}`. 
This makes sure external links are opened in a new window.

## Text, but other formats are also welcome

Although text is the most used format in the Data Privacy Handbook, we encourage other formats that may suit the content,
such as videos, infographics and click-through decision trees. Keep in mind that the format must suit the purpose and should increase understandability. 

## Inclusivity

In line with the Utrecht University guidelines, we want the Data Privacy Handbook to be inclusive:

- Use gender-neutral rather than gendered words where possible. So "they", instead of "he" or "she".
- Include alternate text for images.
- Make sure there is sufficient contrast to distinguish different parts of a visual component.
- Include transcripts for videos, except if the video already has closed captions.
