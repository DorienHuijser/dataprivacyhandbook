# Data Privacy Handbook

## ‚ú®Welcome!‚ú®

You have found the repository that underlies the Data Privacy Handbook, developed at Utrecht University, the Netherlands üá≥üá±. You can find the online book here: https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/. 

In short, the Data Privacy Handbook is an attempt by Utrecht University (UU) data support to create a knowledge base and tool overview for researchers about handling privacy-sensitive research data. Please note that its contents are never finished, and you are pleasantly invited to contribute!

## Background: the Data Privacy Project
The realization of the Data Privacy Handbook is part of a larger project within UU data support: the "Data Privacy Project". The aim of this project is to build knowledge, tools, and experience of how researchers can and should deal with privacy-sensitive data, with an emphasis on pseudonymization and anonymization techniques and tools. At the moment, knowledge about this appears limited or at best, scattered - both among researchers as well as research supporters. This is likely because different disciplines or projects encounter different issues and/or approach them from different angles. Moreover, there is more privacy-sensitive data in scientific research than previously thought, and questions about translating privacy-related legislation into practical guidelines are getting more and more ubiquitous and complex. 

The specific project goals are as follows:  
- üß† Create a **knowledge base** and an overview of **available tools** for researchers to learn about handling privacy-sensitive data. The current Data Privacy Handbook repository will form the central location of this deliverable.
- üõ†Ô∏è Realize or expand a number of **tools** to solve concrete problems of research projects in this area. 
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Develop a record of **use-cases** that are typical of various privacy-related questions to learn from.
- üîç Perform **qualitative and quantitative investigations** into the current practices and needs of UU research staff concerning the handling of privacy-sensitive data.
- üí™ Develop various **training materials** for researchers and support staff about dealing with privacy-sensitive data and the use of the available tools.  

In all goals mentioned above, we want to collect information that is practical, actionable, reusable and accessible. Therefore, we are working together with privacy professionals, researchers and everyone in between to get a perspective that is as widely supported and applicable as possible.
