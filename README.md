## ‚ú®Welcome!‚ú®

The Data Privacy Handbook is a guide to handling personal data in scientific research, in line with European data protection and privacy regulations.  

You can find the Handbook here: https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/. You are currently viewing the GitHub repository that underlies the Handbook - this is where the Handbook is built and maintained. 

Feel free to take a look around the repository! This README will give you an overview of the project. You can jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.

## About the Handbook

### This is an open-source, community-driven, _living_ Handbook.  

- ü§ù As an _open-source_, _community-driven_ Handbook, anyone can get involved and contribute! You'd help us build something that is hopefully useful to many.  
- üå± As a _living_ Handbook, the content can be continually edited and updated. 

### Content

The Data Privacy Handbook consists of: a knowledge base, an overview of privacy-enhancing techniques & tools, and use cases.  

- üß† The _knowledge base_ serves to introduce readers to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), explain how it applies to scientific research, and describe how scientific research can be carried out in a GDPR-compliant manner.
- üõ†Ô∏è The overview of _privacy-enchancing techniques & tools_ will introduce readers to privacy-enchancing techniques (PETs) such as anonymization and pseudonymization, and illustrate how these techniques can be implemented with available developed tools.
- üë®üèΩ‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüë®üèª The _use cases_ will be featured as practical examples to draw inspiration from. 

### Style / Approach

While we call it a 'Handbook' - it's not meant to be written or read like a textbook. Our goal is to make knowledge and solutions surrounding this topic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and present them in a practical and actionable format. 

- As far as possible, we'll keep the text short and sweet. We'd be delighted if we end up with entire 'chapters' presented in the form of an infographic or flowchart.
- The 'chapters' will follow a linear structure, but they need not be read one by one. Readers can simply navigate to the chapter they need at a given moment.   

### Audience & Authors

Our primary audience is **scientific researchers**. You might catch us saying the Handbook needs to be 'researcher-readable' üôÉ
That being said, **privacy professionals** and **research data management (RDM) staff** might find the Handbook useful for reference or recommendation.

The Handbook is developed at Utrecht University (UU) in the Netherlands üå∑. In the interest of open science and FAIR principles, we'll be keeping the content insitution-agnostic as far as possible. Nonetheless, some sections or chapters might be opinionated towards UU policies and preferences.  

## A Little More Background

The Data Privacy Handbook is part of a larger project within UU: the _Data Privacy Project_. The aim of this project is to develop knowledge, tools, and experience of how researchers can and should deal with personal data, with an emphasis on pseudonymization and anonymization techniques and tools. Specifically, the project goals are as follows:  

1. üß† Create a **knowledge base** and an overview of **available tools** for researchers to learn about handling personal data. The _Data Privacy Handbook_ forms the basis for this this deliverable.  
2. üõ†Ô∏è Realize or expand a number of **tools** to solve concrete problems of research projects in this area. For this, we will take on **use cases** that are typical of various privacy-related questions.
3. üîç Perform **qualitative and quantitative investigations** into the current practices and needs of UU research staff concerning the handling of privacy-sensitive data.
4. üí™ Develop various **training materials** for researchers and support staff about dealing with personal data and the use of the available tools.
