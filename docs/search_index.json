[["index.html", "Data Privacy Handbook Welcome!", " Data Privacy Handbook Utrecht University 2021-11-05 Welcome! The Data Privacy Handbook is a guide on handling personal data in scientific research, in line with European data protection and privacy regulations. It consists of: A knowledge base which explains how the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming) applies to scientific research, including guidelines and good practices in carrying out GDPR-compliant scientific research; An overview of privacy-enhancing techniques &amp; tools and practical guidance on their implementation; Use Cases in the form of research projects with privacy-related issues, for which a reusable solution (e.g., tool, workflow) has been developed. The Data Privacy Handbook synthesizes information across various sources and presents it a practical and actionable format. This includes workflows, tools, and practical translations of the GDPR , which could be used by researchers and (data) support staff within Utrecht University and beyond. This is an Utrecht University (UU) community-driven, open-source project. You can visit our GitHub repository here. We welcome feedback and contributions of any type, please read our contributing guidelines for more information. The Data Privacy Handbook is an initiative of Research Data Management Support at the Utrecht University Library, in collaboration with privacy and data experts at Utrecht University. It is part of a larger Data Privacy Project, that aims to develop knowledge, tools, and experience on how researchers can and should deal with personal data. This project is funded by the Utrecht University Research IT Program and an NWO Digital Competence Center grant. You can read more about the Data Privacy Project here.
