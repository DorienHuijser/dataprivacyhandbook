\emph{Utrecht University, 18 November 2022}

The Data Privacy Handbook is a guide on handling personal data in scientific
research, in line with European data protection and privacy regulations. It
consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \textbf{knowledge base} which explains how the EU General Data Protection
  Regulation (GDPR, Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming) applies to
  scientific research, including guidelines and good practices in carrying out
  GDPR-compliant scientific research;
\item
  An overview of privacy-enhancing \textbf{techniques \& tools} and practical guidance
  on their implementation;
\item
  \textbf{Use Cases} in the form of research projects with privacy-related issues,
  for which a reusable solution (e.g., tool, workflow) has been developed.
\end{itemize}

The Data Privacy Handbook synthesises information across various sources and
presents it a \emph{practical} format. This includes workflows, tools, and practical
translations of the GDPR, which could be used by researchers and (data) support
staff within Utrecht University and beyond.

The Data Privacy Handbook is an initiative of
Research
Data Management Support at the Utrecht University Library, in collaboration with privacy and data experts at
Utrecht University. It is part of a larger project,
the
Data Privacy Project, which aims to develop knowledge, tools, and experience
on how researchers can and should deal with personal data. This project is
funded by the Utrecht University Research IT Program and an NWO Digital
Competence Center grant.

This is an Utrecht University (UU) community-driven,
open-source project.
We welcome feedback and contributions of any type, please read our contributing guidelines for more information.

Am I a processor as employee of my university?

No.~As an employee you are still determining your own why (research question)
and how (methods) of personal data processing. This makes you a controller,
acting as an ``agent'' of the legal controller (your university). Read more on the
difference between processors and controllers on the
definitions page.

\hypertarget{chapter-summary}{%
\subsection{Chapter summary}\label{chapter-summary}}

The GDPR is a EU-wide regulation that controls the processing of personal data.
If you process personal data, you should:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Make sure you have a legal basis to process the
  data. In research, this is often informed consent.
\item
  Be transparent and fair towards data subjects.
\item
  Be specific in which personal data you process and for what purposes. Limit
  the amount of data you process to what is necessary, and only store the data
  for that necessary amount of time.
\item
  Protect the confidentiality of the data by incorporating
  privacy by design into your project from the start.
\item
  Make sure your data subjects can exercise their
  data subjects' rights, and they know how to
  do so.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{what-is-the-gdpr}{%
\section{What is the GDPR?}\label{what-is-the-gdpr}}

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Dutch: \emph{Algemene Verordening
Gegevensbescherming} {[}AVG{]}) is an EU-wide regulation meant to protect the privacy
of individuals within a rapidly growing technological society. The GDPR facilitates
the free movement of personal data within the European Economic Area (EEA). Its
data processing principles are meant to ensure a fair balance between competing
interests -- for example, the right to conduct research vs.~the right to protect
personal data (Articles 13 and 8, from the Charter of Fundamental right of the EU).

\hypertarget{the-gdpr-in-a-nutshell}{%
\subsubsection{The GDPR in a nutshell}\label{the-gdpr-in-a-nutshell}}

All articles and recitals of the GDPR can be found online via \url{https://gdpr-info.eu/}.
The video below highlights some important aspects of the GDPR:

Click to read the English video transcript

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates what we can
and cannot do with personal data such as a person's name, sexual orientation,
home address and health. This also applies to personal data used in research
and education. The regulation consists of 88 pages. Fortunately, the basics
are easy to remember in 3 steps:

First, there must be a clear legal basis for processing personal data. This can
include consent, a legal obligation, or public interest.

Second, appropriate technical and organisational measures must be taken
while processing personal data to ensure maximum privacy.

Lastly, the persons whose data you have collected must always have the
option of inspecting, changing, or removing their personal data.

That is the GDPR in a nutshell.

\hypertarget{gdpr-scope}{%
\subsubsection{When does the GDPR apply?}\label{gdpr-scope}}

The GDPR has been applicable from May 2018 onward and applies when:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  you are processing personal data
  (material scope, art. 2).
\item
  the controller or processor of the data \emph{resides} in the EEA (territorial
  scope, art. 3).
  This is independent of whether the actual processing takes place in the EEA.
  In some cases, the GDPR also applies when the controller or processor is not
  established in the EEA, but is processing data from EU citizens.
\end{itemize}

If you are collecting or using data that originated from individuals (or is
related to individuals), it is very likely that the GDPR applies to your project.
You can read more in the chapter What are personal data?.

\hypertarget{implementation}{%
\subsubsection{Implementation}\label{implementation}}

While the GDPR is a regulation for the entire EEA, each EEA country can additionally
implement further restrictions and guidelines in national implementation laws. The
Dutch implementation law is called ``Uitvoeringswet AVG (UAVG)''
(most recent version).
The UAVG determines, for example, that it is forbidden to process Citizen
Service Numbers (BSN), unless it is for purposes determined by a law or a
General Administrative Order (AMvB).

\hypertarget{definitions}{%
\section{Definitions in the GDPR}\label{definitions}}

Below, you will find a selection of important terms in the GDPR that you should
become familiar with when working with personal data (also included in the
Definitions). Click a term to see the definition.

Data subject

A living individual who can be identified directly or indirectly through
personal data. In a research setting, this would be the individual whose
personal data is being processed (see below for the definition of processing).

Personal data

Any information related to an identified or identifiable (living) natural
person. This can include identifiers (name, identification number, location
data, online identifier or a combination of identifiers) or factors specific
to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
identity of the person. Moreover, IP addresses, opinions, tweets, answers to
questionnaires, etc. may also be personal data, either by itself or through a
combination of one another.

Of note: as soon as you collect data related to a person that is identifiable,
you are processing personal data. Additionally, pseudonymised data is still
considered personal data. Read more in
What are personal data?.

Special categories of personal data

Any information pertaining to the data subject which reveals any of the below categories:

racial or ethnic origin

political opinions

religious or philosophical beliefs

trade union membership

genetic and biometric data when meant to uniquely identify someone

physical or mental health conditions

an individual's sex life or sexual orientation

The processing of these categories of data is prohibited, unless one of
the exceptions of Article 9
applies. For example, an exception applies when:

the data subject has provided explicit consent to process these data for
a specific purpose,

the data subject has made the data publicly available themselves,

processing is necessary for scientific research purposes.

Contact your privacy
officer if you wish to process special categories of personal data.

Processing

Any operation performed on personal data. This includes collection, storage,
organisation, alteration, analysis, transcription, sharing, publishing, deletion, etc.

Controller

The natural or legal entity that, alone or with others, determines or has an
influence on why and how personal data are processed. On an
organisational level, Utrecht University (UU) is the controller of personal
data collected by UU researchers and will be held responsible in case of GDPR
infringement. On a practical level, however, researchers (e.g., Principal
Investigators) often determine why and how data are processed, and are thus
fulfilling the role of controller themselves.

Processor

A natural or legal entity that processes personal data on behalf of the
controller. For example, when using a cloud transcription service, you often
need to send personal data (e.g., an audio recording) to the transcription
service for the purpose of your research, which is then fulfilling the role
of processor. When using such a third party, you must have a
data processing agreement in place.

Legal basis

Any processing of personal data should have a valid legal basis. Without it,
you are now allowed to process personal data at all. The GDPR provides 6 legal
bases which are explained further in this chapter.

Anonymous data

Any data where an individual is irreversibly de-identified, both directly
(e.g., through names and email addresses) and indirectly. The latter means
that you cannot identify someone:

by combining variables or datasets (e.g., a combination of date of birth,
gender and birthplace, or the combination of a dataset with its name-number key)

via inference, i.e., when you can deduce who the data are about (e.g.,
when profession is Dutch prime minister, it is clear who the data is about)

by singling out a single subject, such as through unique data points
e.g., someone who is 210 cm tall is relatively easy to identify)

Anonymous data are no longer personal data and thus not subject to GDPR
compliance. In practice, anonymous data may be difficult to attain and care
must be given that the data legitimately cannot be traced to an individual in
any way. The document
Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymisation Techniques
explains the criteria that must be met for data to be considered anonymous.

Pseudonymous data

Personal data that cannot lead to identification without additional
information, such as a key file linking pseudonyms to names. This additional
information should be kept separately and securely and makes for
de-identification that is reversible. Data are sometimes pseudonymised by
replacing direct identifiers (e.g., names) with a participant code (e.g.,
number). However, this may not always suffice, as sometimes it is still
possible to identify participants indirectly (e.g., through linkage, inference
or singling out). Importantly, pseudonymous data are still personal data and
therefore must be handled in accordance with the GDPR.

\hypertarget{gdpr-principles}{%
\section{Principles in the GDPR}\label{gdpr-principles}}

\textbf{The GDPR has a number of principles at its core which dictate the (method of)
data processing. Every type of processing has to comply with these principles.
Understanding these principles is the first step to determining what type of
personal data can be collected and how they can processed.}

The GDPR principles are explained further below the image. The
next chapter will describe how to implement these
principles in your research. You can also always contact your
privacy officer for help.

\hypertarget{lawful-fair-and-transparent}{%
\subsubsection{1. Lawful, fair and transparent}\label{lawful-fair-and-transparent}}

When working with personal data, your processing should be:

Lawful

Make sure all your processing activities (e.g., data collection, storage,
analysis, sharing) have a legal basis. Ideally,
you should have determined your processing purposes (e.g., research questions)
in advance.

Fair

Consider the broad effects of your processing on the rights and dignity of the data subject.

Give data subjects the possibility to exercise their rights.

Avoid deception in the communication with data subjects: processing of personal data should be in line with what they can expect.

The processing of personal data should not have a disproportionate negative, unlawful, discriminating or misleading effect on data subjects.

Transparent

Be transparent in the communication to your data subjects
about who is processing the personal data (controllers, processors), which
personal data are processed, as well as why and for how long, and how data
subjects can exercise their rights. The information provided should be
unambiguous, concise, easily accessible and relevant and shared with data
subjects before the start of your research.

\hypertarget{purpose-limitation}{%
\subsubsection{2. Purpose limitation}\label{purpose-limitation}}

You can only process (i.e., collect, analyse, store, share, etc.) personal data
for a specific purpose and only for as long as necessary to complete that purpose.
For example, if you communicated to data subjects that you would use their
personal data only to answer your specific research question, you cannot further
share the personal data for new research questions, as these would be additional
processing purposes. This means that you need to \textbf{plan what you will do with
the (collected) personal data in advance and stick to that plan in order to be
GDPR-compliant}.

\hypertarget{data-minimisation}{%
\subsubsection{3. Data minimisation}\label{data-minimisation}}

You can only process the personal data you need to for your predefined purpose(s),
and not more just because they may ``come in handy later''. This principle makes
sure that, for example, in the event of a data breach, the amount of data exposed
is kept to a minimum.

\hypertarget{accuracy}{%
\subsubsection{4. Accuracy}\label{accuracy}}

The accuracy of personal data is integral to data protection. Inaccurate data
can be a risk for data subjects, for example when they lead to a wrong treatment
in a medical trial. You therefore need to take every reasonable step to remove
or rectify data that is inaccurate or incomplete. Moreover, data subjects have
the right to request that inaccurate or
incomplete data be removed or rectified within 30 days.

\hypertarget{storage-limitation}{%
\subsubsection{5. Storage limitation}\label{storage-limitation}}

You can only store personal data for as long as is
necessary to achieve your (research) purpose. Afterwards, they need to be
removed. If the personal data are part of your research data (and not, for
example, to simply contact data subjects), you are allowed to store (archive)
them for a longer period of time, provided necessary safeguards are in place.
This is an exemption that applies to data storage for scientific archiving
purposes. You need to inform the data subjects on this storage duration beforehand.

If identification of the data subject is no longer needed for your
(research) purposes, you do not need to keep storing the personal data just
to comply with the GDPR, even if it means your data subjects cannot exercise
their rights (art. 11).

\hypertarget{integrity-and-confidentiality}{%
\subsubsection{6. Integrity and confidentiality}\label{integrity-and-confidentiality}}

You have to process personal data securely and protect against unauthorised
processing or access, loss or damage. To this end, you should put in place
apropriate organisational and technical measures.

\hypertarget{accountability}{%
\subsubsection{7. Accountability}\label{accountability}}

The controller is ultimately responsible for demonstrating GDPR-compliance. As a
researcher working with personal data, you are representing your institution
(e.g., Utrecht University) and you should therefore be able to demonstrate that
you process personal data in a compliant manner. Additionally, you should also
have some knowledge of data protection so that you can implement the right
measures into your research project.

\hypertarget{legal-basis}{%
\section{Legal bases for working with personal data}\label{legal-basis}}

You can only process personal data if you have a \textbf{legal basis} to do so, which
should be registered, among other information, in the
processing register and
communicated to data subjects. There are 6 possible
legal bases which are outlined below. In research, the legal bases `informed
consent', `public interest' and to some extent `legitimate interests of the
controller' are most often used.

\textbf{For different purposes in your research project, a different
legal basis may apply}. For example, you may contact data subjects before they
start participating based on a legitimate interest and use informed consent for
collecting, storing, analysing and publishing the data.

\hypertarget{legal-bases-suitable-for-research}{%
\subsection{Legal bases suitable for research}\label{legal-bases-suitable-for-research}}

Informed consent

Informed consent is the most frequently used legal basis in research and
is often not only a legal (GDPR-consent), but also an ethical obligation
(e.g., METC informed consent). When using informed consent, you should
be able to demonstrate that the data subject was informed and has given
consent, and for which purpose(s) they gave their consent. In all cases,
consent has to be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. Please
refer to the Informed consent section
for guidance on applying informed consent in your research.

Public interest

Public interest is sometimes used in research when the research is shown
to clearly benefit the public good or fulfills a public task. In
essence, public interest can be used for research that is conducted by
employees of public institutions, when their research interest has been
recognised by an official authority. For example, conducting research at
Dutch universities has been officially recognised in the
Higher Education and Scientific Research Act
to be a public task. Public interest is often used when consent is not
a good option. For example, it may be impossible or impractical to
obtain consent when performing public observations or social media
research. Or when participants actually do not have a free choice, such
as in clinical trials when participants would experience significant
disadvantages when not participating.

If you want to use public interest as a legal basis, you
need to assess the necessity and proportionality of your processing.
Additionally, you need to demonstrate that the interests of data
subjects do not override your research interests. To do so, please contact your
privacy officer
to assess whether you can use this legal basis in your research.

Legitimate interest of the controller

Legitimate interest is often used by companies to process personal data
necessary for the functioning of their own company, e.g., processing
user data for fraud prevention, or keeping a registration system to
provide better services. In research, legitimate interest is often used
for processing activities that have no direct research purpose. For
example, this can be the case when you need to collect contact
information to approach data subjects to participate, and you can only
obtain their consent for participating in your research after contacting
them. Since contacting data subjects is a prerequisite to perform your
research, it can be in the university's legitimate (research) interest
to process their contact information.

To evaluate whether you can use legitimate interest as a legal basis, you
always need to weigh the interests of the controller (e.g., Utrecht
University) and the data subjects in a
Legitimate interest assessment.
Please contact your privacy officer to assess whether you can use this
legal basis in your research.

\hypertarget{legal-bases-not-suitable-for-reseach}{%
\subsection{Legal bases not suitable for reseach}\label{legal-bases-not-suitable-for-reseach}}

Processing is necessary because of a legal obligation of the controller

This basis is not suitable for research. As an example, Utrecht
University has to share tax data with the Dutch tax administration in
order to comply with tax legislation.

Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract

This basis is not suitable for research. As an example, Utrecht
University has contracts with its employees, which require it to manage
the employees' financial data.

Processing is necessary to protect a person's vital interests

This basis is generally not suitable for research. If processing
someone's personal data is crucial to their health or even life, that
processing is allowed under the GDPR.

\hypertarget{further-processing}{%
\subsection{Further processing for research purposes}\label{further-processing}}

It may happen that you want to process personal data for other purposes than
previously specified (e.g., because you formulated an additional research
question), or you want to reuse previously collected personal data in your
research. In these cases, it may be possible to make use of
article 5(1)(b),
which states that ``further processing for {[}\ldots{]} scientific purposes shall {[}\ldots{]}
not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes''. Basically, this
means that you can reuse personal data, that were previously collected for other
purposes, for scientific research purposes. This is only allowed if you put in
place sufficient safeguards to protect the personal data, inform data subjects,
and allow them to exercise their rights
(art. 89).
``Further processing'' is not strictly a legal basis. Instead, it functions as a
way to legitimise \emph{further} processing of personal data (which was previously
collected for a different purpose, using one of the six legal bases) for research
purposes.

Public interest, legitimate interest, and relying on further processing are ways
to meet your \emph{legal} requirements for processing personal data, but not
necessarily your \emph{ethical} requirements: you may still need consent if demanded
so from an ethical perspective. Before you rely on any of these, you should
first assess whether they are indeed suitable with your faculty
privacy officer,
and determine whether your research interests outweigh the privacy rights of
the data subjects.

\hypertarget{data-subject-rights}{%
\section{Data Subjects' Rights}\label{data-subject-rights}}

The GDPR provides data subjects with several rights that gives them a relatively
high degree of control over their own personal data. Below, we list these rights
and how you can apply them in your research:

Right to be informed

Data subjects need to be clearly informed about what you are doing with their
personal data (a.o. art. 12).
This usually happens via a privacy notice or information letter. This right
does not apply if your research will be seriously harmed by meeting it and if
you haven't obtained the personal data directly from the data subjects themselves.

Right of access

Data subjects have the right to access a copy of the personal data you have
on them and to know what you are doing with that personal data and why
(art. 15).

Right to rectification

Data subjects have the right to correct and complement the personal data
that you have of them
art. 16).

Right to erasure/Right to be forgotten

Data subjects have the right to have their personal data removed (i.e.,
equivalent to the right to withdraw consent,
art. 17).
This right does \textbf{not} need to be granted if:

the personal data are published and need to be archived for validation
purposes.

it would seriously obstruct the research purpose(s).

it would hinder complying with a legal obligation or carrying out a task
in the public interest.

If the personal data have already been made public or shared, you need to
take reasonable measures to inform other users of the data of the erasure
request. A privacy officer can help you with this.

Right to restriction of processing

Data subjects have the right to have you process less of their personal data
(art. 18),
for example if their personal data are inaccurate or your processing of it
is unlawful or no longer needed.

Right to data portability

Data subjects have the right to have their personal data transferred to
another party (art. 20).

Right to object

Data subjects have the right to object to what you are doing with their
personal data. This right applies when the processing is based on legitimate
or public interest (art. 21).
In case of objection, you have to stop your processing activities, unless
you can demonstrate grounds for overriding the data subject's rights.

\hypertarget{how-can-data-subjects-exercise-their-rights}{%
\subsubsection{How can data subjects exercise their rights?}\label{how-can-data-subjects-exercise-their-rights}}

Data subjects need to be \textbf{informed} about their rights and who to contact in
order to exercise them, including when you use a legal basis other than informed
consent. In research, this is usually done via a
privacy notice or information letter, which states
a contact person responsible for handling questions and requests.

Incoming requests need to be \textbf{coordinated with a privacy officer}, so that
they can be picked up in accordance with the GDPR. Additionally, at Utrecht
University, data subjects can always contact
\href{mailto:privacy@uu.nl}{\nolinkurl{privacy@uu.nl}} (the Data Protection Officer) for
requests or complaints.

\hypertarget{what-to-do-when-receiving-a-request-concerning-data-subjects-rights}{%
\subsubsection{What to do when receiving a request concerning data subjects' rights?}\label{what-to-do-when-receiving-a-request-concerning-data-subjects-rights}}

You have to provide a substantive response to the data subject \textbf{within 30 days},
in the same way as you received the request. Depending on the complexity and
number of requests, the response period may be extended by 2 months. In that
case, you must inform the data subject about this extension (including the
motivation) within one month. If needed, you can (and sometimes should) ask for
additional information to confirm the data subject's identity.

For granting requests about data subjects' rights, there should be a procedure
in place, in which you should at least consider:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  how you are going to retrieve the data (e.g., using a name-number key)
\item
  who is responsible for granting the request and informing the data subject
  about it (e.g., a data manager)
\item
  how the request is going to be granted, for example how they will be sent
  securely (access, portability), removed (forgotten, object, restriction) or
  corrected (rectification)
\end{itemize}

For larger projects, it may be wise to put a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
in place.

\hypertarget{what-if-the-data-have-already-been-anonymised}{%
\subsubsection{What if the data have already been anonymised?}\label{what-if-the-data-have-already-been-anonymised}}

The principles of data minimisation and storage limitation are considered more
important than keeping personal data just for the sake of identification
(art. 11).
Therefore, when receiving a request about anonymised data, you can make it clear
that you cannot retrieve the data subject's personal data, because they have
been anonymised. In this case, \textbf{the data subject cannot exercise their rights
anymore}. If you can still retrieve the data subject's personal data in some
way (i.e., when data are pseudonymised), you are \textbf{obliged to retrieve them}.
In order to do so, you can (and sometimes should) ask for additional information
that can confirm the data subject's identity.

\hypertarget{personal-data}{%
\chapter{What are personal data?}\label{personal-data}}

In order to know whether you should comply with the GDPR in your research
project, the first question to answer is: do you process personal data? To
answer this question, we need to know: (1) What exactly are personal data,
and (2) how do you know if you are working with personal data in your research?

\hypertarget{definition-personal-data}{%
\section{Definition of personal data}\label{definition-personal-data}}

According to the GDPR, personal data are ``any information relating to an
identified or identifiable natural person''
(art.4(1)):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Natural person}: Data by themselves (numbers, text, pictures, audio, etc.)
  are not inherently personal. They only become personal when they refer to or
  relate to a \textbf{living individual}. When data refer to an organisation,
  deceased person, or group of individuals, they are not considered personal data
  under the GDPR.
\item
  Data are personal if they \textbf{relate} to an individual. This means practically
  anything that someone is, has said or done, owns, may think, etc.
\item
  The person should be \textbf{identified or identifiable}. This is the case not
  only through \textbf{directly} identifying information, such as names and contact
  information, but also through \textbf{indirectly} identifying information, for
  example if you can single someone out or identify them by combining datasets
  (see the next page).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{personal-data-assess}{%
\section{How to assess whether data contain personal data?}\label{personal-data-assess}}

Whether your data contain personal data depends on which data you are
collecting (nature) and under which circumstances (context). A date like
``12 December 1980'', is not personal data -- it is just a date. However, that
date becomes personal data if it refers to someone's birthday.

In assessing whether data are personal, you should take into account all the
means that you and others may \textbf{reasonably likely} use to identify your data
subjects, such as the required money, time, or (future) developments in
technology (rec. 26).

Data can be identifiable when:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  They contain \textbf{directly identifying information}.

  Examples (click to expand)

  name, image, video recording, audio recording, patient number, IP address,
  email address, phone number, location data, social media data
\item
  It is possible to \textbf{single out} an individual, for example when there are
  unique data points or unique behavioural patterns which can only apply to one
  person.

  Examples

  You have a data subject who is 2.10 meters tall. If this is a unique
  value in your dataset, this distinguishes this person from others and thus
  can make them identifiable.

  You have a data subject who only follows far-right accounts on Twitter.
  If they are the only one in your dataset who do so, this distinguishes this
  person from others and can make them identifiable.
\item
  It is possible to \textbf{infer information} about an individual based on information
  in your dataset.

  Examples

  Inferring a medical condition based on registered medications.

  Guessing that someone lives in a certain neighborhood based on where they go to school.
\item
  It is possible to \textbf{link records} relating to an individual. This can happen
  when combining multiple variables within your dataset (e.g., demographic
  information, indirect identifiers). However, it can also happen when combining
  your dataset with other datasets (the ``Mosaic effect''). In that case, your data
  still contain personal data, even if the data in your dataset are not
  identifiable by themselves.

  Examples

  Linkage is often possible with demographic information (age,
  gender, country of origin, education, workplace information, etc.) and
  indirect identifiers (pseudonyms, device ID, etc.), for example:

  In the year 2000, 87\% of the United States population
  was found to be identifiable using a combination of their ZIP code, gender
  and date of birth.

  An agricultural company's Uniek Bedrijfsnummer (UBN) can be used to
  search for the address of the company in the
  I\&R mobile app.
  Often, this address is also the owner's home address.
\item
  De-identification is still \textbf{reversible}. This often happens when data are
  pseudonymised, but there is still a way to link the pseudonymised data with
  identifiable data, for example when a name-pseudonym key still exists.
\end{itemize}

You can assume that you are processing personal data when you collect data
\textbf{directly} from people, even if the results of that collection are anonymous. But
also when you use data that are \textbf{observed or derived from people}, even if those
data were previously collected, made public or used for non-research purposes.

In short, even if you cannot find out someone's real identity (name, address),
the data you process can still contain personal data under the GDPR. Besides
the examples mentioned here, there are many
other examples of personal data. If you need help assessing whether or not your
data contain personal data, please contact your
privacy officer
or data manager.

\hypertarget{special-types-personal-data}{%
\section{Special types of personal data}\label{special-types-personal-data}}

There are a few special types of personal data that are worth taking note of:
special categories of personal data, and otherwise sensitive personal data.
These types of personal data have additional requirements. If you want to
process them, please contact your
privacy officer
first.

\hypertarget{special-categories-of-personal-data}{%
\subsection{Special categories of personal data}\label{special-categories-of-personal-data}}

The GDPR explicitly defines seven `special categories of personal data'. It is
information that reveals:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  racial or ethnic origin
\item
  political opinions
\item
  religious or philosophical beliefs
\item
  trade union membership
\item
  genetic or biometric data when meant to uniquely identify someone
\item
  physical or mental health conditions
\item
  sex life or sexual orientation
\end{itemize}

It is in principle \textbf{prohibited} to process these types of personal data,
unless an exception applies
(art.9). For
example, it is allowed to process these if:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data subjects have provided explicit consent to process these data for a
  specific purpose
\item
  Data subjects have made the data publicly available themselves
\item
  Processing is necessary for scientific research purposes (incl.~historical
  and statistical purposes)
\end{itemize}

Even if you can make use of one of these exemptions, special categories of
personal data warrant additional security measures to make sure they are
protected. Always contact your
privacy officer
if you intend on processing these types of data.

\hypertarget{data-that-are-otherwise-sensitive}{%
\subsection{Data that are otherwise sensitive}\label{data-that-are-otherwise-sensitive}}

Other types of data can also be sensitive, because they can carry higher risks
for the data subjects. These types of data can either not be processed at all,
or only under certain circumstances. Either way, they require additional
security measures. Always contact your
privacy officer
if you intend on using these types of data.

Examples are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Financial data
\item
  Data about relationship problems
\item
  Data that can be misused for identity fraud, such as the Dutch Citizen
  Service Number (BSN). In principle, the BSN cannot be used in research at all.
\item
  Criminal or justice-related data: they can only be processed under
  governmental supervision or when a derogation exists in national legislation
  (art. 10).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{privacy-by-design}{%
\chapter{Designing your project}\label{privacy-by-design}}

Research projects typically go through a number of stages: conception, proposal,
planning, execution, publishing, preservation, etc. If you work with personal
data, you should think about how you will protect those data throughout all
those stages. To do so, the concepts of Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default
(art. 25) are
important:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Privacy by Design} in research means that your project integrates personal
  data protection right from the beginning, all the way throughout the project,
  and even afterwards. It should not be an afterthought: Privacy by Design is a
  key feature of the project, permeating all phases of a research project.
\item
  \textbf{Privacy by Default} in research means that any questions, tools, or methods
  you use in your research should process as little personal data as necessary by
  default, and that you share the personal data only with those who really need
  access.
\end{itemize}

To get proper support in designing your project, it is important to contact your
privacy officer
early on, preferably already in the conception or design phase. The privacy
officer will help you go through the different stages smoothly, and eventually
save you time and effort. They can help you review and possibly adjust your
plans, determine the appropriate protection measures, and determine whether you
need to perform a more elaborate Data Protection Impact Assessment.

\hypertarget{design-strategies}{%
\section{Privacy by Design strategies}\label{design-strategies}}

To incorporate the concepts of Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default into
your project, the approach of \textbf{privacy design strategies}
(Hoepman, 2022)
offers a way to make the GDPR principles more concrete. Hoepman distinguishes 8
strategies that you can apply to protect the personal data in your research:
minimise, separate, abstract, hide, inform, control, enforce, and demonstrate.
In the next sections, we explain what these mean and how you can apply them.

The GDPR does not prescribe \emph{which} specific measures you should apply in your
project, only that they should protect the personal data \emph{effectively}. Which
measures will be effective, will depend on your specific project, the risks for
data subjects, and the current progress in technology (i.e.~will the data be
protected on the long haul?).

\hypertarget{data-oriented-strategies}{%
\section{Data-oriented strategies}\label{data-oriented-strategies}}

\hypertarget{minimise}{%
\subsection{Minimise}\label{minimise}}

Limit as much as possible the processing of personal data, for example by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Collecting as little data as possible to reach your research purpose.
\item
  Preferably not using tools that automatically collect unnecessary personal
  data. If possible, prevent tools you do use from doing so (Privacy by Default).
  For example, the survey tool Qualtrics can automatically register location data,
  which can be turned off by using the
  ``Anonymize Responses'' option.
\item
  Removing personal data when you no longer need them. Remove them from
  repositories, data collection tools, sent emails, back-ups, etc. (see also the
  Storage chapter).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{separate}{%
\subsection{Separate}\label{separate}}

Separate the processing of different types of personal data as much as possible,
for example by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pseudonymisation: Store directly
  identifying personal data (e.g., contact information) separately from the
  research data. Use identification keys to link both datasets, and store these
  keys also separately from the research data.
\item
  Using different databases to separate datasets.
\item
  Applying secure computing techniques, where
  the data remain at a central location and do not have to be moved for the analysis.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{abstract}{%
\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Limit as much and as early on as possible the detail in which personal data
are processed, for example by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Anonymising or pseudonymising the data.
\item
  Adding noise to the data, e.g., voice alteration in audio data.
\item
  Summarising the data to simply describe general trends instead of individual
  data points.
\item
  Synthesising the data, e.g., for sharing trends
  in the data without revealing individual data points.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hide}{%
\subsection{Hide}\label{hide}}

Protect personal data, or make them unlinkable or unobservable. Make sure they
do not become public or known. You can for example do so using a combination of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using encryption, hashing or
  strong passwords to protect data. Keep in mind that you
  should store passwords securely as well!
\item
  Using encrypted transport protocols (such as TLS, SFTP, HTTPS, etc.).
\item
  Applying privacy models like Differential Privacy,
  where noise is added to individual data points to hide their true identity.
\item
  Only providing access to people who really need it, and only for the necessary
  amount of time and with the necessary authorisations (e.g., read vs.~write
  access; only the relevant selection of personal data, etc.). Remove
  authorisations when access is no longer required.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{process-oriented-strategies}{%
\section{Process-oriented strategies}\label{process-oriented-strategies}}

\hypertarget{inform}{%
\subsection{Inform}\label{inform}}

Inform data subjects about the processing of their personal data in a timely
and adequate manner, for example by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Providing information via an
  information letter or privacy notice on a project
  website.
\item
  Providing verbal explanation before an interview.
\item
  Obtaining explicit consent via an informed consent procedure.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{control}{%
\subsection{Control}\label{control}}

Give data subjects adequate control over the processing of their personal data,
for example by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Specifying a procedure and responsible person in case data subjects want to
  exercise their data subject rights.
\item
  Providing data subjects with a contact point (e.g., email address) for
  questions and exercising their data subject rights.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{enforce}{%
\subsection{Enforce}\label{enforce}}

Commit to processing personal data in a privacy-friendly way, and adequately
enforce this, for example by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using only
  Utrecht University-approved tools
  to collect, store, analyse and share data.
\item
  Entering into agreements with third parties if they
  are working with UU-controlled personal data. Such agreements will make sure
  everyone will treat the data up to UU-standards.
\item
  Always keeping your software up-to-date.
\item
  Appointing someone responsible for regulating access to the data.
\item
  Always reporting
  data breaches.
  At UU, contact the Computer Emergency Response Team.
\item
  If needed, drawing up a privacy and/or security policy that specify roles and
  responsibilities and best practices on how personal data are handled throughout
  a project.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{demonstrate}{%
\subsection{Demonstrate}\label{demonstrate}}

Demonstrate you are processing personal data in a privacy-friendly way, for
example by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Registering your research project in the UU processing register (once available).
\item
  Performing a Privacy Scan and storing it
  alongside the personal data.
\item
  Performing a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for
  projects that have a high privacy risk for the data subjects.
\item
  Keeping information for data subjects and (signed) informed consent forms on
  file. This is not needed if you can fully anonymise the data: then you should
  delete the (signed) consent forms as well.

\hypertarget{privacy-notices}{%
\section{Privacy notices}\label{privacy-notices}}

\textbf{A privacy notice is any information given to data subjects about what is
happening with their personal data. In research, a privacy notice is usually
combined with general information about the research project and often with an
informed consent form, to satisfy both privacy and ethical concerns. Generally,
the aim of a privacy notice is to inform data subjects on how and why their
data are being processed. Providing that information is the ``cornerstone of
data subjects' rights'', as without it, data subjects cannot exercise their other
privacy rights.}

\hypertarget{when-to-use-a-privacy-notice}{%
\subsection{When to use a privacy notice?}\label{when-to-use-a-privacy-notice}}

Informing data subjects is always required, for \textbf{all \protect\hyperlink{legal-basis}{legal bases}}
(so not only when you use informed consent). Being properly informed is a data
subject's right in itself (art. 12):
it is necessary so that data subjects can exercise their \protect\hyperlink{data-subject-rights}{other rights}
(e.g., right to be forgotten, right to object, etc.).

You need to inform data subjects \textbf{before} you start collecting or otherwise
processing their personal data (so before the start of your research project).

When you use personal data from another source, you have to inform your data
subjects within a month after obtaining their data
(art. 14), except
if this would involve a disproportionate effort, or would seriously impair your
processing purposes (e.g., if you cannot answer your research question anymore,
art. 14(5)(b)).
If you share personal data with an external party, you should inform data
subjects at the latest when first sharing those data with that external party.

\subsection{Content and examples of privacy notices}\label{content-and-examples-of-privacy-notices}}

``Your data will be fully anonymised before they are shared with others.''

``We will remove personal information that could reasonably identify you before we share any files with other researchers.''

``All data that you will provide will be kept strictly confidential and will not be shared further.''

``The main researcher will keep a link that identifies you to your coded information. They will keep this link secure and available only to the selected members of the research team.''

``Your data will only be accessible by the research team, and no one else.''

``We will only share your de-identified data with other researchers if they agree to treat your data confidentially and only after approval from the original research team.''

``You can withdraw your consent from this study at any time up until the end of the research project. If you withdraw your consent, we will delete all your data from our dataset immediately.''

``You can withdraw your consent from this study at any time, without stating a reason why and without any repercussions. Please inform the researcher about your decision. We will then delete any personal data referring to you that we still have, where this is still possible.''

\hypertarget{form-of-a-privacy-notice}{%
\subsection{Form of a privacy notice}\label{form-of-a-privacy-notice}}

The format of the privacy notice is also crucial. Even if you include all
necessary components in your privacy notice, it will \textbf{not be GDPR-compliant}
if you fail to provide the information in an appropriate form, shape and time.

The information you provide to data subjects should be:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Clear and understandable}
  A privacy notice is not a legal document, so do not write it like you would
  write a legal contract. The information should be understandable for data
  subjects and it should have a clear and concrete meaning. For example, avoid
  using words like ``may'', ``some'', ``often'' and write active and short sentences.
\item
  \textbf{Easily accessible}
  Data subjects should be able to find the information easily. For example, publish
  the privacy notice on your project website, give participants a copy, or provide
  a QR-code or short URL.
\item
  \textbf{Via multiple channels (when appropriate)}
  Textual information sheets are by no means the only way to inform data subjects.
  If appropriate, you can provide the information via other channels too, e.g.,
  oral statements, images, audio, video
  (example),
  etc. For some data subjects, such other channels of informing can lead to a better
  understanding of your processing activities.
\item
  \textbf{Layered (when appropriate)}
  To balance being complete with being understandable, you can layer the
  information you provide. For example, provide concise information up front and
  provide more detailed information elsewhere (e.g., via a link or dropdown menu).
\end{itemize}

If you are uncertain about the level of intelligibility and transparency of the
information, you can test these, for example through user panels, readability
testing, or by interactions with data subjects themselves (or their
representatives).

\hypertarget{informed-consent-forms}{%
\section{Informed consent}\label{informed-consent-forms}}

\textbf{Of the 6 possible legal bases to process personal data, informed consent is
currently the one most often used in research. With the term consent, we mean
the process of data subjects deciding whether or not to agree to specific
statements, such as a statement to participate in a research project.}

  Determine if consent is the legal basis you need for your
  research: there are other legal bases besides consent which can sometimes be
  more suitable in a research context.

  In some situations, consent is likely the only way to process data, for
  example, if you want to process
  special categories of personal data,
  or if you process personal data from children under 16 years old. In the latter
  case, the GDPR requires to obtain additional obtain consent from a legal
  representative (e.g., parent), and there are additional requirements when your
  research falls under the Dutch
  Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act.
\item
  Consider if you meet all requirements for consent

  If you need to use consent as a legal basis, consider if you meet
  all requirements listed below. If you do not,
  consent is not a valid legal basis, and you should consider another one.
\item
  Determine what you will ask consent for

  Determine what specifically you are asking consent for. If you cannot
  determine a specific purpose, for instance because your research question is
  not yet entirely clear, contact
  your privacy officer
  to consider obtaining broad consent.
\item
  Prepare information for data subjects

  Prepare a
  privacy notice or information letter
  for data subjects to inform them before asking for their consent.
\item
  Obtain demonstrable consent

  Different forms of consent are valid. Note
  that often a signature is not required.
\item
  Keep the consent forms available

  Treat the consent declarations as personal data:
  store them separately and securely from the
  research data, and for as long as your research data contain personal data.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the term ``consent'' is used both in the GDPR as well as in an ethical
context. As a legal basis, data subjects give consent
to process their personal data (e.g., ``I consent to my data a, b, c be used for
purpose x, y, z''). In an ethical context, consent is a
safeguard
to give data subjects more control over their personal data, and makes sure they
participate voluntarily in the research project (e.g., ``I have read the
information and agree to participate under the conditions described''). Thus, it
can happen that consent is not be the best legal basis to use, but should still
be used as an ethical requirement.

\hypertarget{consent-requirements}{%
\subsection{Requirements for valid consent}\label{consent-requirements}}

Under the GDPR, consent is only valid when it is \textbf{all} of the below
(art. 4,
art. 7,
rec. 32,
rec. 42,
rec. 43;
click to expand):

Freely given

Data subjects should have an actual voluntary choice and should not experience
negative consequences if they don't consent or withdraw their consent. Moreover,
they should not be pressured to provide consent, and so there cannot be a power
imbalance between the controller (e.g., researcher) and data subjects
(rec. 43).
Some examples:

Consent is not valid when the researcher is also a teacher and asks their
students to participate, who depend on the teacher for a good grade. In this
case, another legal basis such as public interest may be more appropriate.

Consent can still be used for children and persons legally incapable to
provide consent when their legal representative(s) provide the consent.

Specific

Data subjects should know as specifically as possible what they are asked to
consent to. Separate processing purposes therefore require explicitly separate
consent (rec. 32,
rec. 43), and
accompanying specific information that will allow the data subjects to decide
if they consent or not. If consents for multiple purposes are necessary for your
research, you can combine those.
Some examples:

Combined consent may be possible to collect, store, analyse, and share
personal data with your collaborators -- all actions are needed to answer your
research question.

Separate consent is needed for conducting a survey vs.~for conducting a
subsequent interview, if participation in that interview is not required for
your research project.

Separate consent is needed for the current research project vs.~for contacting
data subjects for future research projects.

Informed

Data subjects need to be clearly and accessibly informed about which personal
data are processed and why, and about their rights (see
Privacy notices). Data subjects should be
able to access this information easily (also after they have provided
consent).

Unambiguous and affirmative

It should be clear what data subjects are providing consent for, using
a clear, affirmative statement. Importantly, ``silence, pre-ticked boxes or
inactivity'' do not constitute valid consent
(rec. 32):
consent should be active.

\hypertarget{forms-consent}{%
\subsection{What forms of consent are valid?}\label{forms-consent}}

The way you obtain consent may differ per research project and can depend on
how you interact with your data subjects. The only requirement is that it should
be demonstrable. Some examples:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ticking a box (\textbf{not} pre-ticked!)
\item
  Writing or replying to an email (``I agree to be interviewed'')
\item
  Filling in an electronic form
\item
  Audio- or video-recorded consent (separate it from the research data!)
\item
  Signing a paper document (not usually necessary)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{to-sign-or-not-to-sign}{%
\subsubsection{To sign or not to sign?}\label{to-sign-or-not-to-sign}}

Signatures in consent forms are rarely needed. In fact, if you are only
processing \emph{pseudonymised} research data, you will only collect unnecessary
personal data by obtaining a signature
(art. 11), and a
checkbox should be sufficient. In order to link the consent form with the data
subject, you should include the pseudonym on the consent form (the identifier
you will use for the participant, e.g., ``part-001''). Inform your participants
of this pseudonym; they can use it to exercise their rights under the GDPR,
such as for withdrawing their consent.

Only when the identity of the data subjects will be used in the process (e.g.,
clinical trials), a signature may make sense or be required. For example, if
your research is subject
to the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO),
different requirements apply,
e.g., consent needs to be provided in writing using a signature and date.

\hypertarget{demonstrate-consent}{%
\subsection{Demonstrating (valid) consent}\label{demonstrate-consent}}

As long as you process personal data, you should be able to demonstrate that the
data subjects consented to that processing
(rec. 42).
So as long as you analyse, use, store, archive, etc. the personal data, the
proof of consent needs to be retained. It is preferable to store the proofs
separately from the research data. If you collected consent on paper, it is
best practice to scan the consent forms and securely delete the paper version
after having made sure the scanning went well. Only after there is no personal
data anymore (e.g., after fully anonymising the dataset), you can remove the
proof of consent.

\hypertarget{broad-consent}{%
\subsection{Broad consent in research}\label{broad-consent}}

In research, it can sometimes be difficult to formulate very specific research
questions in advance. In this case, you may be able to formulate the research
purposes on a more general level and obtain consent for these more general
purposes
(EDPS, 2020;
Deutsche Datenschutzkonferenz, 2019).
However, you can do this only as long as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  data subjects can give consent to only part of the research and easily
  withdraw consent
  (rec. 33).
\item
  data subjects are kept informed as specifically as possible about what will
  happen to their personal data. As soon as you know more, you should also inform
  data subjects in more detail.
\item
  you use additional protection measures, for example:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    obtain ethical approval for using the data for new research questions.
  \item
    offer a consent withdrawal possibility before using the data for new research
    questions. This is especially relevant when it is still possible to reliably
    identify data subjects in the dataset.
  \item
    make sure the data are not transferred to countries outside of the EEA,
    unless one of the derogations from GDPR
    Chapter V
    applies (e.g., adequacy decision, standard contractual clauses, explicit
    consent for transfer).
  \item
    enforce specific requirements for access the data, e.g., ``research in general''
    is not a sufficiently specific purpose for reuse of the personal data.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  you document your considerations and ask for help from a
  privacy officer.
\end{itemize}

Note that all examples below assume that they are preceded by
sufficiently specified information.

Example sentences

Good example sentences:

``I consent to the collection and use of my personal data to answer the
research question described in the information letter.''

``I consent to linking the new research data to data previously collected
about me in this research project.''

``I agree that research data gathered for the study may be published or
made available provided my name or other identifying information is not used.''

``I understand that the research data, without any personal information
that could identify me (not linked to me) may be shared with other researchers.''

Bad example sentences:

``Any information I give will be used for this research project only and
will not be used for any other purpose'': this restricts all future uses of
the data, including sharing the data with your collaborators, performing
analyses for new research questions, and sharing the data for reuse. It's
preferred to tell data subjects how their data can be safely used in
different ways.

``I do not give consent to share my data'': this sentence is ambiguous and
may confuse data subjects.

``I acknowledge that the personal data collected by the researcher belongs
to the university and that I have no rights in the research performed on it'':
it is not allowed to deny data subjects their data subjects' rights.

When you are using a tool that processes personal data, that tool should do so
in compliance with the GDPR. If you work at Utrecht University (UU), you can use
\url{https://tools.uu.nl} to find not only suitable
storage media
and data repositories,
but also an
overview of which tools are safe to use.
It contains for example tools for audio transcription, file sharing, and performing
surveys.

Most of the tools listed are safe to use either because no (personal)
data are being used by the tool, data are processed at UU premises, or because
of a Data Processing Agreement between
UU and the supplier of the tool, in which the supplier agreed to
sufficiently protect the data entered into their tool.

\hypertarget{tool-requirements}{%
\section{Requirements for a third-party tool}\label{tool-requirements}}

\textbf{If your tool of choice is not listed in \url{https://tools.uu.nl}, please contact
IT servicedesk. They will help you assess
whether a tool is safe to use. If a tool is processing personal data, two aspects
are important to consider: 1) who is controlling the personal data, and 2) the
security level of the tool.}

\hypertarget{who-is-processing-the-personal-data-arrange-an-agreement}{%
\subsection{1. Who is processing the personal data: arrange an agreement}\label{who-is-processing-the-personal-data-arrange-an-agreement}}

When you use a third-party tool that processes personal data, the data are not
under the (full) control of your employer. In this case, it is required to
ensure GDPR compliance of the tool provider using
(art. 46):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A Data Processing Agreement -
  when the provider processes (e.g., stores, analyses, collects) personal data
  within the European Economic Area (EEA) or a country with an
  adequate level of data protection.
\item
  Standard
  contractual clauses (SCCs) - when personal data are processed by a
  supplier outside of the EEA. These make sure the provider will use
  sufficient measures to protect the personal data and enable data subjects to
  exercise their rights.
\item
  Explicit consent of data subjects who have been informed on the risks
  involved - in the absence of an agreement. Please contact your
  privacy officer
  if you are considering this option.
\end{itemize}

You can assume agreements are in place for the tools recommended by UU.
If there is no agreement in place between UU and the tool provider, using
this tool is \textbf{not allowed}, even if the provider is located within the EEA,
has an adequate level of data protection, or has high security standards. The
only exception is when data are always end-to-end encrypted, because then the
tool provider cannot learn anything from the data.

\hypertarget{security-level}{%
\subsection{2. Security level}\label{security-level}}

The tool provider should employ good security practices, such as regular back-ups
in distinct geographical areas (preferably in replication rather than on tape),
regular integrity checks, encryption at rest, multi-factor authentication, etc.
Most of these aspects will likely be covered in the agreement, and sometimes a
data classification will need to be performed.
Information security can help you determine all
necessary security requirements.

\chapter{Storing personal data}\label{data-storage}}

In research, storage of personal data is one of the most common processing
activities. Assuming you have a legal basis to store personal data, you
then need to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Choose a storage medium that is GDPR-compliant and that provides a sufficient
  level of data protection;
\item
  Take into account procedural and legal aspects, e.g., how will you handle the
  data once they are stored, and for how long will you store the data?
\end{itemize}

These aspects of storing personal data are discussed in this chapter.

\hypertarget{chapter-summary-1}{%
\subsection{Chapter summary}\label{chapter-summary-1}}

\textbf{Where should I store personal data?}

Use a medium that has been approved by your institution. If you work at Utrecht
University, and your preferred storage medium is not included in the
Storage Finder,
then please contact
RDM Support
or your privacy officer
to find an alternative solution.

\textbf{How to store personal data?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Apply organisational and technical safeguards,
  e.g., restrict access, encrypt data, pseudonymise data, specify responsibilities, etc.
\item
  Store (personal) data preferably in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
  and interoperable format: others should be able to open, understand and work
  with your data.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For how long should I store personal data?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Delete or fully anonymise personal data when they are no longer necessary,
  and preferably determine when you will do this in advance.
\item
  In research, you can archive personal data that are necessary for validation
  purposes for a longer period of time, e.g., 10 years or longer.
\end{itemize}

\section{Where should I store personal data?}\label{data-storage-where}}

\hypertarget{storage-media-at-uu}{%
\subsection{Storage media at UU}\label{storage-media-at-uu}}

If you work at Utrecht University (UU), you can find a suitable storage medium for
digital research data via the Storage Finder (see below). For personal data, select Basic,
Sensitive or Critical (depending on the sensitivity of your data) under question
4 about Confidentiality.

Most storage media in this overview are suitable for storing personal data, either
because they are controlled by UU (e.g., U- and O-drive, Beta File System) or
because UU has a Data Processing Agreement in place with the storage supplier
(e.g., Microsoft Office 365, Yoda, SURFdrive).

Is your preferred storage medium not included in the storage finder? Contact
RDM Support, your data steward, or your
privacy officer to find an alternative solution.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider encrypting your data, especially when using \textbf{portable devices}
  (e.g, memory sticks, phones). Portable devices are also not suitable as back-up,
  due to bit rot and being easily lost.
\item
  Physical personal data (e.g., paper questionnaires, informed consent forms)
  should be stored securely too, e.g.~in a locked room, cabinet or drawer. You
  should also avoid leaving unsecured copies lying around (e.g., on a desk or printer).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Do not store research data containing personal data on public cloud services},
e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, Mega, iDrive, iCloud, NextCloud, etc.
These services are not (always) GDPR-compliant and/or may not offer sufficient
data security. Moreover, UU does not have any formal agreements with these
services, enabling them to use the data stored on their platforms for their own
purposes.

\hypertarget{data-storage-how}{%
\section{How should I store personal data?}\label{data-storage-how}}

\textbf{Once you have chosen a suitable storage medium, you should act in accordance
with the nature of your data as well}, for example through:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Controlling access: make sure that only the necessary people have the right
  kind of access (e.g.~read/write) to the personal data, and remove their access
  when they do not longer need it (e.g.~when someone leaves the research project).\\
\item
  Specifying responsibilities, e.g.~who is responsible for guarding access to the
  data on both the short and the long term? Make people aware of the confidential
  nature of the data. Tell them what to do in case of a
  data breach.
\item
  Procedural arrangements, e.g.~capture access conditions in
  agreements like the consortium agreement,
  data processing agreement or non-disclosure agreement.
\item
  Storing different types of personal data in different places, e.g., research
  data should be stored separately from data subjects' contact details.
\item
  Applying other safeguards where appropriate, e.g., encryption, anonymisation,
  pseudonymisation, etc. (see chapter Privacy-enhancing
  techniques).
\end{itemize}

See Designing a GDPR-compliant research project for more tips.

Personal data should be stored in a \textbf{``structured, commonly used, machine-readable
and interoperable format''} (rec. 68).
In practice, this means that you should consider whether your files are
structured and named in a logical way, use
sustainable file formats,
and provide understandable metadata so that others can interpret the data.
You can read more about this in the RDM guide
``Storing and preserving data''.

\hypertarget{data-storage-duration}{%
\section{For how long should I store personal data?}\label{data-storage-duration}}

\textbf{As per the GDPR, anyone processing personal data can only store those for as
long as is necessary for prespecified purposes
(art. 5(e)).
Afterwards, the personal data have to either be fully anonymised or deleted.
However, there is an exemption for research data, as described below.}

In research, we often see a division in different types of retention periods:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the personal data underpin a scientific publication, it is usually necessary
  to archive some personal data for \textbf{integrity and validation purposes}
  (art. 5(e)),
  because they are part of the research data. At UU, any research data necessary
  for validation should be archived for at least 10 years
  (UU research data policy).
  If this includes personal data, they too should be archived. Importantly, this
  still means that you need to \textbf{protect} the personal data, and \textbf{limit} the personal
  data stored to the amount necessary for validation
  (art. 89)!
  This also implies that you should keep the documentation about the legal basis
  used (e.g., consent forms) during that time, so that you can demonstrate GDPR
  compliance.
\item
  Specific retention periods may apply additionally to specific types of data.
  For example, in the Netherlands there are specific retention periods for medical data.
\item
  Personal data that were used for purposes other than answering your
  research question (e.g.~contact information) should have their own retention
  policy: they should be removed or anonymised after the retention period
  (e.g.~the research project) has ended.
\end{itemize}

For all types of data in your project (incl.~to be archived research data), we
recommend to formulate which data you will retain and for how long (for example
in your Data Management Plan), and communicate the (possibly different)
retention period(s) to data subjects. If you want to change the storage term you
initially set and communicated for your personal data, please contact your
privacy officer.

\hypertarget{deleting-personal-data}{%
\subsection{Deleting personal data}\label{deleting-personal-data}}

If you do not need personal data anymore, you must delete it, except when the data
should be archived for validation purposes. Data deletion should be done in a
reliable manner, for example to ensure that there are no visible or hidden copies
being left behind on any device. The Storage Finder will soon include information on how to do
this for each UU-approved storage medium. Additionally, you can read more on
how to safely delete data in the RDM guide ``Storing and preserving data''.

\hypertarget{data-sharing-collaboration}{%
\chapter{Sharing data with collaborators}\label{data-sharing-collaboration}}

This chapter addresses guidelines to take into account when you want to share
personal data with collaborators outside of your own institution \textbf{during}
your research project. For guidelines to share personal data after a research
project, please refer to the chapter on
Data sharing for reuse.

To be able to share personal data with external collaborators, you should:

1. Make sure you have a legal basis and
inform data subjects

Make sure data subjects are well-informed about your intentions to
share the data with collaborators. Include information in your
privacy notice on the identity of your
collaborators, which data are shared with them and why, how, and for how
long. Avoid using statements that preclude sharing such as ``Your data
will not be shared with anyone else''.

Make sure you have a legal basis to
share the data, e.g., informed consent or public interest. If you use
consent, make sure that data subjects are aware that they are also
providing consent to share their data with your collaborators.

Inform data subjects timely - before you start processing
their data - and proactively - directly if possible.

2. Protect the personal data appropriately

Assess the risks of sharing the
data and the measures you will take to mitigate those in your
Data Management Plan, Privacy scan,
or if applicable, Data Protection Impact Assessment.
This is especially important if you will share your data with
collaborators outside of the European Economic Area.

Share only the data that the collaborator needs (data minimisation),
for example by deleting unnecessary data, pseudonymising the data, and
sharing only with those who need access to the data.

Make sure data subjects can still exercise their
data subjects' rights. For example,
if a data subject withdraws their consent, not only you, but also your
collaborators will have to stop processing the data subject's personal
data. It is important to make clear how you and them will do so.

3. Come to agreements with collaborators

In order to protect the personal data effectively, it is important to
determine which role every collaborator has:
controller or processor? And if there are
multiple controllers, are they separate or joint controllers? For example,
in many collaborative research projects (e.g., in consortia), there are
multiple controllers that collectively determine why (e.g., research
question) and how (e.g., methods) to process personal data. These parties
are then joint controllers, and agreements need to be made in a
joint controllers agreement.

In any collaboration in which data are shared, you need to (art. 26):

Come to a formal agreement on:

The role of each party in the research project

Respective responsibilities in terms of data protection, such as informing data subjects and handling requests relating to data subjects' rights

Who is the main point of contact for data subjects

Communicate (the essence of) the agreement to data subjects.

Your
privacy officer
can help you draw up a valid agreement.

4. Pay special attention to third-country transfers

If you share personal data with international collaborators (for example,
with countries that have no
adequacy decision),
you may need to take additional measures. Usually, these measures include
drawing up an agreement to make sure the other party is GDPR-compliant and
uses the necessary security measures (if you haven't already done so). The
exact type of agreement will depend on your specific situation: your
privacy officer
can help you choose and set up the right one.

The flowchart below indicates conditions under which you can share data
internationally. Note that they assume that you have taken sufficient
safeguards to protect the personal data. To determine the possibilities
of sharing data internationally in your project, we strongly advise you
to consult with your privacy officer. In some cases a Data Transfer Impact Assessment may
be required, which can take some effort.

5. Use a secure way to share the data

Granting access: It is preferable to grant a user access
to an existing and safe infrastructure (e.g., add someone to a Yoda
group or OneDrive folder), rather than physically sending the data
elsewhere. This allows you to keep the data in one place, define
specific access rights (read/write), have users authenticate, and
easily revoke access to the data after your collaboration has ended.
It is also a good idea to take measures to prevent the data from
being copied elsewhere.

Transferring data: When it is absolutely necessary to
transfer the files to a different location, you must do so securely.

SURF Filesender
with encryption.

\chapter{Publishing metadata}\label{open-science-questionnaire}}

In 2020, the
Open
Science Programme of Utrecht University sent out the first
Open Science monitor. The aim was to gain insights into the awareness,
attitudes, practices, opportunities and barriers of employees of Utrecht
University and Utrecht University Medical Center regarding several Open
Science practices. As the dataset contained a lot of demographic information
(e.g., gender, age, nationality, position, type of contract, etc.), and all of
those variables combined could lead to identification, it could not be shared
publicly. For this particular dataset, full anonymisation was not desirable,
as that would greatly decrease its scientific value. Therefore, the Open Science
Programme chose to publish only the metadata and documentation, without sharing
the data, in order to protect participants' data while still complying with the
FAIR principles.

Here's the strategy they took:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  They published the dataset under
  restricted

For a course, a teacher at the faculty of Veterinary Medicine collected data on
the health of pets and the pets' owners. The initial purpose of the survey was
to create simply datasets for students to learn about statistics. However,
besides for the course, the teacher also wanted to use the collected data for
research purposes and share the data with others. In order to do so, the teacher
created a new version of the survey that asked for less identifiable information
and could be more easily anonymised. Additionally, the new version of the survey
informed participants about the legal basis used to process their personal data.

Here, you can find the survey before and after data minimisation:

Before minimisation
After minimisation

Note that the new version of the survey:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  minimises the amount of personal data collected:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Student number and pet names are not asked in the new version of the survey.
  \item
    Instead of Age, the new version asks the Age category of the owner/caretaker.
  \item
    The survey includes questions on Weight and Height. For data publication,
    they are used to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and deleted after this
    calculation.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  contains information about the legal basis used to be able to use (legitimate
  interest) and publish (consent) the data for purposes other than education.

The glossary consists of frequently used jargon concerning the GDPR and research data.

\hypertarget{a}{%
\subsubsection{A}\label{a}}

Anonymous data

Any data where an individual is irreversibly de-identified, both directly (e.g., through names and email addresses) and indirectly. The latter means that you cannot identify someone:

by combining variables or datasets (e.g., a combination of date of birth, gender and birthplace, or the combination of a dataset with its name-number key)

via inference, i.e., when you can deduce who the data are about (e.g., when profession is Dutch prime minister, it is clear who the data is about)

by singling out a single subject, such as through unique data points (e.g., someone who is 210 cm tall is relatively easy to identify)

Anonymous data are no longer personal data and thus not subject to GDPR compliance. In practice, anonymous data may be difficult
to attain and care must be given that the data legitimately cannot be traced to an individual in any way. The document
Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymisation Techniques
explains the criteria that must be met for data to be considered anonymous.

\hypertarget{c}{%
\subsubsection{C}\label{c}}

Controller

The natural or legal entity that, alone or with others, determines or has an influence on why and how
personal data are processed. On an organisational level, Utrecht University (UU) is the controller of personal data
collected by UU researchers and will be held responsible in case of GDPR infringement. On a practical level, however,
researchers (e.g., Principal Investigators) often determine why and how data are processed, and are thus fulfilling the
role of controller themselves.

\hypertarget{d}{%
\subsubsection{D}\label{d}}

Data subject

A living individual who can be identified directly or indirectly through personal data. In a research setting,
this would be the individual whose personal data is being processed (see below for the definition of processing).

\hypertarget{e}{%
\subsubsection{E}\label{e}}

European Economic Area (EEA)

The member states of the European Union and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. In total, the EEA now consists of
30 countries. The aim of the EEA is to enable the ``free movement of goods, people, services and capital'' between countries,
and this includes (personal) data (source:
Eurostat).

\hypertarget{h}{%
\subsubsection{H}\label{h}}

Hashing

Hashing is a way of replacing one or multiple variables with a string of
random characters with a fixed length. It can be used to create a ``hashed''
pseudonym, or to replace multiple variables with one unique value. It is
usually quite difficult to reverse the hashing process, except if an attacker
has knowledge about the type of information that was masked through hashing.
To prevent reversal, cryptographic hashing techniques add a ``salt'', i.e., a
random number or string, to the hash (the result is called a ``digest''). If
the ``salt'' is kept confidential or is removed (similar to a keyfile), it is
almost impossible to reverse the hashing process.

\hypertarget{l}{%
\subsubsection{L}\label{l}}

Legal basis

Any processing of personal data should have a valid legal basis. Without it, you are now allowed to process personal data at all.
The GDPR provides 6 legal bases: consent, legitimate interest, public interest, legal obligation, performance of a contract, vital
interest. Consent and public and legitimate interest are most often used in a research context.

\hypertarget{p}{%
\subsubsection{P}\label{p}}

Personal data

Any information related to an identified or identifiable (living) natural person, for example identifiers (name, identification number,
location data, online identifier or a combination of identifiers) or factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
economic, cultural or social identity of the person. Moreover, IP address, opinions, tweets, answers to questionnaires, etc. may also be
personal data, either by itself or through a combination of one another.

Of note: as soon as you process data related to a person that is identifiable, you are processing personal data. Additionally,
pseudonymised data is still considered personal data. Read more in Designing a GDPR-compliant research project.

Processing

Any operation performed on personal data, including collection, storage, organisation, alteration, analysis,
transcription, sharing, publishing, deletion, etc.

Processor

A natural or legal entity that processes personal data on behalf of the controller. For example, when using
a cloud transcription service, you often need to send personal data (e.g., an audio recording) to the transcription
service for the purpose of your research, which is then fulfilling the role of processor. When using such a third party,
you must have a data processing agreement in place.

Pseudonymous data

Personal data that cannot lead to identification without additional information,
such as a key file linking pseudonyms to names. This additional information should be kept separately and securely
and makes for deidentification that is reversible. Data are sometimes pseudonymised by replacing direct identifiers
(e.g., names) with a participant code (e.g., number). However, this may not always suffice, as sometimes it is still
possible to identify participants indirectly (e.g., through linkage, inference or singling out). Importantly, pseudonymous
data are still personal data and therefore must be handled in accordance with the GDPR.

\hypertarget{s}{%
\subsubsection{S}\label{s}}

Special categories of personal data

Any information pertaining to the data subject which reveals any of the below categories:

racial or ethnic origin

political opinions

religious or philosophical beliefs

trade union membership

genetic and biometric data when meant to uniquely identify someone

physical or mental health conditions

an individual's sex life or sexual orientation

The processing of these categories of data is
prohibited, unless one of the exceptions of
art. 9 applies.
For example, an exception applies when:

the data subject has provided explicit consent to process these data for a specific purpose

the data subject has made the data publicly available themselves

processing is necessary for scientific research purposes

Contact your privacy officer if you wish to process special categories of personal data.
