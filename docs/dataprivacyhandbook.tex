The Data Privacy Handbook is a guide on handling personal data in scientific
research, in line with European data protection and privacy regulations. It
consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \textbf{knowledge base} which explains how the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming) applies to scientific research, including guidelines and good practices in carrying out GDPR-compliant scientific research;
\item
  An overview of privacy-enhancing \textbf{techniques \& tools} and practical guidance on their implementation;
\item
  \textbf{Use Cases} in the form of research projects with privacy-related issues, for which a reusable solution (e.g., tool, workflow) has been developed.
\end{itemize}

The Data Privacy Handbook synthesizes information across various sources and
presents it a \emph{practical} and \emph{actionable} format. This includes workflows,
tools, and practical translations of the GDPR , which could be used by researchers
and (data) support staff within Utrecht University and beyond.

This is an Utrecht University (UU) community-driven, open-source project.
You can visit our GitHub repository here.
We welcome feedback and contributions of any type, please read our
contributing guidelines
for more information.

The Data Privacy Handbook is an initiative of
Research Data Management Support
at the Utrecht University Library,
in collaboration with privacy and data experts at Utrecht University. It is part of a larger Data Privacy Project,
that aims to develop knowledge, tools, and experience on how researchers can and
should deal with personal data. This project is funded by the Utrecht University
Research IT Program and an NWO Digital Competence Center grant. You can read more
about the Data Privacy Project here.

\chapter*{The GDPR}\label{gdpr}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{The GDPR}

\textbf{This chapter will present the most important definitions, principles and rights of data subjects
under the GDPR and how you can apply them in your research. Most of the practical advice that we
provide in this Handbook is rooted in and builds on the concepts presented here.}

\hypertarget{what-is-the-gdpr}{%
\subsubsection{What is the GDPR?}\label{what-is-the-gdpr}}

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Dutch: \emph{Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming} {[}AVG{]})
is an EU-wide regulation meant to protect the privacy of individuals within a rapidly growing technological
society. The GDPR facilitates the free movement of personal data within the European Economic Area (EEA).
Its data processing principles are meant to ensure a fair balance between competing interests -- for example,
the right to conduct research vs.~the right to protect personal data (Art 13 and 8, from the Charter of
Fundamental right of the EU).

\hypertarget{the-gdpr-in-a-nutshell}{%
\subsubsection{The GDPR in a nutshell}\label{the-gdpr-in-a-nutshell}}

All articles and recitals of the GDPR can be found online via \url{https://gdpr-info.eu/}.
The video below highlights some important aspects of the GDPR:

Click to read the English video transcript

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates what we can and cannot do
with personal data such as a person's name, sexual orientation, home address and health.
This also applies to personal data used in research and education. The regulation consists
of 88 pages. Fortunately, the basics are easy to remember in 3 steps:

First, there must be a clear legal basis for processing personal data, for instance,
because you have consent, because there is a legal obligation, or because the processing is
necessary for the public interest.

Second, appropriate technical and organisational measures must be taken while processing
personal data to ensure maximum privacy.

Lastly, the persons whose data you have collected must always have the option of inspecting,
changing, or removing their personal data.

That is the GDPR in a nutshell.

\hypertarget{when-does-the-gdpr-apply}{%
\subsubsection{When does the GDPR apply?}\label{when-does-the-gdpr-apply}}

The GDPR has been applicable from May 2018 onwards and applies when:

you are processing personal data (material scope,
art. 2).

the controller or processor of the data resides in the EEA (territorial scope,
art. 3).
This is independent of whether the actual processing takes place there. In some cases, the GDPR
also applies when the controller or processor is not established in the EEA, but is
processing data from EU citizens.

\textbf{If you are collecting or using data that originated from individuals (or is related to individuals),
it is very likely that the GDPR applies to your project.}

\hypertarget{implementation}{%
\subsubsection{Implementation}\label{implementation}}

Whereas the GDPR is a regulation for the entire EEA, each EEA country can additionally
implement further restrictions and guidelines in national implementation laws. The Dutch
implementation law is called ``Uitvoeringswet AVG (UAVG)''
(most recent version).
The UAVG determines, for example, that it is forbidden to process Citizen Service Number (BSN),
unless for purposes determined by a law or a General Administrative Order (AMvB).

\hypertarget{definitions}{%
\section*{Definitions in the GDPR}\label{definitions}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Definitions in the GDPR}

Below, you can find a selection of important terms in the GDPR that you should be familiar with
when working with personal data (also included in the Definitions).
Click a term to see the definition.

Data subject

A living individual who can be identified directly or indirectly through personal data.
In a research setting, this would be the individual whose personal data is being processed
(see below for the definition of processing).

Personal data

Any information related to an identified or identifiable (living) natural person, for example
identifiers (name, identification number, location data, online identifier or a combination of
identifiers) or factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
cultural or social identity of the person. Moreover, IP address, opinions, tweets, answers
to questionnaires, etc. may also be personal data, either by itself or through a combination of one another.

Of note: as soon as you process data related to a person that is identifiable, you are
processing personal data. Additionally, pseudonymised data is still considered personal data.
Read more in Designing a GDPR-compliant research project.

Special categories of personal data

Any information pertaining to the data subject which reveals any of the below categories:

racial or ethnic origin

political opinions

religious or philosophical beliefs

trade union membership

genetic and biometric data when meant to uniquely identify someone

physical or mental health conditions

an individual's sex life or sexual orientation

The processing of these categories of data is prohibited, unless one of the
exceptions of art. 9 applies.
For example, an exception applies when:

the data subject has provided explicit consent to process these data for a specific purpose

the data subject has made the data publicly available themselves

processing is necessary for scientific archiving purposes

Contact your privacy officer
if you wish to process special categories of personal data.

Processing

Any operation performed on personal data, including collection, storage, organisation,
alteration, analysis, transcription, sharing, publishing, deletion, etc.

Controller

The natural or legal entity that, alone or with others, determines or has an influence on why
and how personal data are processed. On an organisational level, Utrecht University (UU)
is the controller of personal data collected by UU researchers and will be held responsible
in case of GDPR infringement. On a practical level, however, researchers (e.g., Principal Investigators)
often determine why and how data are processed, and are thus fulfilling the role of controller themselves.

Processor

A natural or legal entity that processes personal data on behalf of the controller. For example,
when using a cloud transcription service, you often need to send personal data (e.g., an audio recording)
to the transcription service for the purpose of your research, which is then fulfilling the role
of processor. When using such a third party, you must have a
data processing agreement in place.

Legal basis

Any processing of personal data should have a valid legal basis. Without it, you are now allowed to
process personal data at all. The GDPR provides 6 legal bases which are explained further
in this chapter.

Anonymous data

Any data where an individual is irreversibly de-identified, both directly (e.g., through names and
email addresses) and indirectly. The latter means that you cannot identify someone:

by combining variables or datasets (e.g., a combination of date of birth, gender and birthplace,
or the combination of a dataset with its name-number key)

via inference, i.e., when you can deduce who the data are about (e.g., when profession is
Dutch prime minister, it is clear who the data is about)

by singling out a single subject, such as through unique data points (e.g., someone who is
210 cm tall is relatively easy to identify)

Anonymous data are no longer personal data and thus not subject to GDPR compliance. In practice,
anonymous data may be difficult to attain and care must be given that the data legitimately cannot
be traced to an individual in any way. The document
Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymisation Techniques
explains the criteria that must be met for data to be considered anonymous.

Pseudonymous data

Personal data that cannot lead to identification without additional information, such
as a key file linking pseudonyms to names. This additional information should be kept separately
and securely and makes for deidentification that is reversible. Data are sometimes pseudonymised
by replacing direct identifiers (e.g., names) with a participant code (e.g., number). However, this
may not always suffice, as sometimes it is still possible to identify participants indirectly
(e.g., through linkage, inference or singling out). Importantly, pseudonymous data are still
personal data and therefore must be handled in accordance with the GDPR.

\hypertarget{gdpr-principles}{%
\section*{Principles in the GDPR}\label{gdpr-principles}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Principles in the GDPR}

\textbf{The GDPR has a number of principles at its core which dictate the (method of) data processing.
Every type of processing has to comply with these principles. Understanding these principles is the
first step to determining what type of personal data can be collected and how they can processed.}

The GDPR principles are explained further below the image. The next chapter
will describe how to implement these principles in your research. You can also always contact your
privacy officer for help.

\hypertarget{lawful-fair-and-transparent}{%
\subsubsection{1. Lawful, fair and transparent}\label{lawful-fair-and-transparent}}

When working with personal data, your processing should be:

Lawful
Make sure all your processing activities (e.g., data collection, storage, analysis, sharing)
have a legal basis. Ideally, you should have determined your
processing purposes (e.g., research questions) in advance.

Fair

Consider the broad effects of your processing on the rights and dignity of the data subject.

Give data subjects the possibility to exercise their rights.

Avoid deception in the communication with data subjects: processing of personal data should
be in line with what they can expect.

The processing of personal data should not have a disproportionate negative, unlawful,
discriminating or misleading effect on data subjects.

Transparent
Be transparent in the communication to your data subjects about who is processing the personal
data (controllers, processors), which personal data is processed, as well as why and for how long,
and how data subjects can exercise their rights (see the Legal documents chapter).
The information provided should be unambiguous, concise, easily accessible and relevant and shared
with data subjects before the start of your research.

\hypertarget{purpose-limitation}{%
\subsubsection{2. Purpose limitation}\label{purpose-limitation}}

You can only process (i.e., collect, analyse, store, share, etc.) personal data for a specific purpose
and only for as long as necessary to complete that purpose. For example, if you only specified
that you would use the personal data to answer your specific research question, you cannot also
share the personal data for reuse purposes, as this is an additional processing purpose. This means
that you need to \textbf{plan what you will do with the (collected) personal data in advance and stick to
that plan in order to be GDPR-compliant}.

In some cases (e.g., for cohort studies), it may not be possible to communicate a specific research purpose in advance. In those cases, you may be able to use ``broad consent'' when possible.
For more information on broad consent and which conditions must be met in that case see the Legal Documents chapter.

\hypertarget{further-processing}{%
\paragraph{Further processing}\label{further-processing}}

It may happen that you want to process personal data for \textbf{similar, but other purposes} than previously
specified, for example because you formulated a research question that was not communicated with the
data subjects. In these cases, the GDPR provides some leeway: you can still process the personal data if
the new processing (e.g., the new research question) is \textbf{compatible} with the original purpose.
Your privacy officer
can help you assess whether this is the case. Of note, \textbf{archiving} personal research data after
your research is finished is allowed in a research context
(art. 5.1(b)), but provided that you
still apply the GDPR's principles and put in place appropriate safeguards
(rec. 156).

\hypertarget{data-minimisation}{%
\subsubsection{3. Data minimisation}\label{data-minimisation}}

You can only process the personal data you need to achieve your predefined purpose(s), and not more just
because they may ``come in handy later''. This principle makes sure that, for example, in the event of a
data breach, the amount of data exposed is kept to a minimum.

\hypertarget{accuracy}{%
\subsubsection{4. Accuracy}\label{accuracy}}

The accuracy of personal data is integral to data protection. Inaccurate data can be a risk for data subjects,
for example when they lead to a wrong treatment in a medical trial. You therefore need to take every reasonable
step to remove or rectify data that is inaccurate or incomplete. Moreover, data subjects have the
right to request that inaccurate or incomplete data be removed
or rectified within 30 days.

\hypertarget{storage-limitation}{%
\subsubsection{5. Storage limitation}\label{storage-limitation}}

You can only store personal data for as long as is necessary to achieve your (research) purpose.
Afterwards, they need to be removed. If the personal data are part of your research data (and not,
for example, to simply contact data subjects), you are allowed to store (archive) them for a longer period
of time, provided the necessary safeguards are in place. This is an exemption that applies to data storage
for scientific archiving purposes. You need to inform the data subjects on this storage duration beforehand.

N.B.: If identification of the data subject is no longer needed for your (research) purposes, you
do not need to keep storing the personal data just to comply with the GDPR, even if it means your
data subjects cannot exercise their rights (art. 11).

\hypertarget{integrity-and-confidentiality}{%
\subsubsection{6. Integrity and confidentiality}\label{integrity-and-confidentiality}}

You have to process personal data securely and protect against unauthorised processing or access,
loss or damage. To this end, you should put in place apropriate organisational and technical measures.
The next chapter will go into such measures in more depth.

\hypertarget{accountability}{%
\subsubsection{7. Accountability}\label{accountability}}

The controller is ultimately responsible for demonstrating GDPR-compliance. As a researcher working with personal data,
you are representing your institution (e.g., Utrecht University) and you should therefore be able to demonstrate
that you process personal data in a compliant manner. Additionally, you should also have some knowledge of
data protection so that you can implement the right measures into your research project.

\hypertarget{legal-basis}{%
\section*{When can I work with personal data?}\label{legal-basis}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{When can I work with personal data?}

You can only process personal data if you have a \textbf{legal basis} to do so, which should be registered,
among other information, in the processing register
and communicated to data subjects. There are 6 possible legal bases
which are outlined below. In research, the legal bases `informed consent', `legitimate interests
of the controller' and `public interest' are most often used.

Please note that \textbf{for different purposes in your research project, a different legal basis may apply}.
For example, you may contact data subjects before they start participating based on a legitimate interest
and use informed consent for collecting, storing, analysing and publishing the data.

\hypertarget{legal-bases-suitable-for-research}{%
\subsection{Legal bases suitable for research}\label{legal-bases-suitable-for-research}}

Informed consent

Informed consent
is the most used legal basis in research and is often not only a legal (GDPR-consent), but also an ethical consideration
(e.g., METC informed consent). When using informed consent, you should be able to demonstrate that the data subject was informed and has
given consent, and for which purpose(s) they gave their consent. In all cases, consent has to be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.
Please refer to the Informed consent section for guidance on applying informed consent in your research.

Legitimate interest of the controller

You can
use this legal basis when processing personal data is necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller (e.g., Utrecht University).
For example, this can be the case when you need to process contact information to approach data subjects to participate, and you can only obtain their
consent after contacting them. Since contacting data subjects is a prerequisite to perform your research, it can be in the university's legitimate research
interest to process their contact information. To evaluate whether you can use legitimate interest as a legal basis, you always need to weigh the interests
of the controller (e.g., Utrecht University) and the data subjects in a Legitimate interest assessment. Please
contact your privacy officer to assess whether you can use this legal basis in your research.

Public interest

This legal basis
can only be used if it can be demonstrated that there is an urgent social necessity for the processing of personal data.
This means that there must be an explicit increase in knowledge in the interest of society. There is currently some disagreement as to when this legal basis
can be applied in research. Therefore, please contact your
privacy officer to assess whether you
can use this legal basis in your research.

\hypertarget{legal-bases-not-suitable-for-reseach}{%
\subsection{Legal bases not suitable for reseach}\label{legal-bases-not-suitable-for-reseach}}

Processing is necessary because of a legal obligation of the controller

This basis
is not suitable for research. As an example, Utrecht University has to share tax data with the Dutch tax administration
to comply with tax legislation.

Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract

This basis
is not suitable for research. As an example, Utrecht University has contracts with its employees, which require
it to manage the employees' financial data.

Processing is necessary to protect a person's vital interests

This basis
is not suitable for research. If processing someone's personal data is crucial to their health or even life,
that processing is allowed under the GDPR.

\hypertarget{data-subject-rights}{%
\section*{Data Subject's Rights}\label{data-subject-rights}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Data Subject's Rights}

The GDPR provides data subjects with several rights that gives them a relatively high degree of control over their own personal data. Below, we list these rights and
how you can apply them in your research:

Right to be informed
Data subjects need to be informed clearly about what you are doing with their personal data
(a.o. art. 12).
This usually happens via a privacy notice or information letter. This right does not apply if
your research will be seriously harmed by meeting it and if you haven't obtained
the personal data from the data subjects themselves.

Right of access
Data subjects have the right to access a copy of the personal data you have of them and to
know what you are doing with that personal data and why (art. 15).

Right to rectification
Data subjects have the right to correct and complement the personal data that you have of them
(art. 16).

Right to erasure/Right to be forgotten
Data subjects have the right to have their personal data removed (i.e., equivalent to the right to withdraw consent,
art. 17). This right does \textbf{not} need to be granted if:

the personal data are published about and need to be archived for validation purposes

it would seriously obstruct the research purpose(s)

it would hinder complying with a legal obligation or carrying out a task in the public interest

If the personal data
have already been made public or shared, you need to take reasonable measures to
inform other users of the data of the erasure request. A privacy officer can help you with this.

Right to restriction of processing:
Data subjects have the right to have you process less of their personal data
(art. 18), for example if their
personal data are inaccurate or your processing of it is unlawful or no longer needed.

Right to data portability:
Data subjects have the right to have their personal data transferred to another party
(art. 20).

Right to object:
Data subjects have the right to object to what you are doing with their personal data. This right applies
when the processing is based on legitimate or public interest
(art. 21). In case of objection, you have to
stop your processing activities, unless you can demonstrate grounds for overriding the data subject's rights.

\hypertarget{how-can-data-subjects-exercise-their-rights}{%
\subsubsection{How can data subjects exercise their rights?}\label{how-can-data-subjects-exercise-their-rights}}

Data subjects need to be \textbf{informed} about their rights and who to contact to exercise them, including
when you use a legal basis other than informed consent. In research, this is usually done via a
privacy notice or information letter, which states a contact person
responsible for handling questions and requests.

Incoming requests need to be \textbf{coordinated with a privacy officer}, so that they can be picked
up in accordance with the GDPR. Additionally, at Utrecht University, data subjects can always
contact \href{mailto:privacy@uu.nl}{\nolinkurl{privacy@uu.nl}} (the Data Protection Officer) for requests or complaints.

\hypertarget{what-to-do-when-receiving-a-request-concerning-data-subjects-rights}{%
\subsubsection{What to do when receiving a request concerning data subjects' rights?}\label{what-to-do-when-receiving-a-request-concerning-data-subjects-rights}}

You have to provide a substantive response to the data subject \textbf{within 30 days}, in the same way as you
received the request. Depending on the complexity and number of requests, the response period may be
extended by 2 months. In that case, you must inform the data subject about this extension (including the
motivation) within one month. If needed, you can (and sometimes should) ask for additional information
to confirm the data subject's identity.

For granting requests about data subjects' rights, there should be a procedure in place, in which you
should at least consider:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  how you are going to retrieve the data (e.g., using a name-number key)
\item
  who is responsible for granting the request and informing the data subject about it (e.g., a data manager)
\item
  how the request is going to be granted, for example how they will be sent securely (access, portability), removed (forgotten, object, restriction) or corrected (rectification)
\end{itemize}

For larger projects, it may be wise to put a Standard Operating Practice in place (example will be added).

\subsubsection{What if the data have already been anonymised?}\label{what-if-the-data-have-already-been-anonymised}}

The principles of data minimisation and storage limitation are considered more important than keeping personal
data just for the sake of identification (art. 11).
Therefore, when receiving a request about anonymised data, you can make clear that you cannot retrieve the data subject's
personal data, because they have been anonymised. In this case, \textbf{the data subject cannot exercise their rights anymore}.
If you can still retrieve the data subject's personal data in some way (i.e., when data are pseudonymised), you are
\textbf{obliged to retrieve them}. In order to do so, you can (and sometimes should) ask for additional information that can
confirm the data subject's identity.

The glossary consists of frequently used jargon concerning the GDPR and research data.

\hypertarget{a}{%
\subsubsection{A}\label{a}}

Anonymous data

Any data where an individual is irreversibly de-identified, both directly (e.g., through names and email addresses) and indirectly. The latter means that you cannot identify someone:

by combining variables or datasets (e.g., a combination of date of birth, gender and birthplace, or the combination of a dataset with its name-number key)

via inference, i.e., when you can deduce who the data are about (e.g., when profession is Dutch prime minister, it is clear who the data is about)

by singling out a single subject, such as through unique data points (e.g., someone who is 210 cm tall is relatively easy to identify)

Anonymous data are no longer personal data and thus not subject to GDPR compliance. In practice, anonymous data may be difficult
to attain and care must be given that the data legitimately cannot be traced to an individual in any way. The document
Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymisation Techniques
explains the criteria that must be met for data to be considered anonymous.

\hypertarget{c}{%
\subsubsection{C}\label{c}}

Controller

The natural or legal entity that, alone or with others, determines or has an influence on why and how
personal data are processed. On an organisational level, Utrecht University (UU) is the controller of personal data
collected by UU researchers and will be held responsible in case of GDPR infringement. On a practical level, however,
researchers (e.g., Principal Investigators) often determine why and how data are processed, and are thus fulfilling the
role of controller themselves.

\hypertarget{d}{%
\subsubsection{D}\label{d}}

Data subject

A living individual who can be identified directly or indirectly through personal data. In a research setting,
this would be the individual whose personal data is being processed (see below for the definition of processing).

\hypertarget{e}{%
\subsubsection{E}\label{e}}

European Economic Area (EEA)

The member states of the European Union and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. In total, the EEA now consists of
30 countries. The aim of the EEA is to enable the ``free movement of goods, people, services and capital'' between countries,
and this includes (personal) data (source:
Eurostat).

\hypertarget{l}{%
\subsubsection{L}\label{l}}

Legal basis

Any processing of personal data should have a valid legal basis. Without it, you are now allowed to process personal data at all.
The GDPR provides 6 legal bases: consent, legitimate interest, public interest, legal obligation, performance of a contract, vital
interest. Consent and public and legitimate interest are most often used in a research context.

\hypertarget{p}{%
\subsubsection{P}\label{p}}

Personal data

Any information related to an identified or identifiable (living) natural person, for example identifiers (name, identification number,
location data, online identifier or a combination of identifiers) or factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
economic, cultural or social identity of the person. Moreover, IP address, opinions, tweets, answers to questionnaires, etc. may also be
personal data, either by itself or through a combination of one another.

Of note: as soon as you process data related to a person that is identifiable, you are processing personal data. Additionally,
pseudonymised data is still considered personal data. Read more in Designing a GDPR-compliant research project.

Processing

Any operation performed on personal data, including collection, storage, organisation, alteration, analysis,
transcription, sharing, publishing, deletion, etc.

Processor

A natural or legal entity that processes personal data on behalf of the controller. For example, when using
a cloud transcription service, you often need to send personal data (e.g., an audio recording) to the transcription
service for the purpose of your research, which is then fulfilling the role of processor. When using such a third party,
you must have a data processing agreement in place.

Pseudonymous data

Personal data that cannot lead to identification without additional information,
such as a key file linking pseudonyms to names. This additional information should be kept separately and securely
and makes for deidentification that is reversible. Data are sometimes pseudonymised by replacing direct identifiers
(e.g., names) with a participant code (e.g., number). However, this may not always suffice, as sometimes it is still
possible to identify participants indirectly (e.g., through linkage, inference or singling out). Importantly, pseudonymous
data are still personal data and therefore must be handled in accordance with the GDPR.

\subsubsection{S}\label{s}}

Special categories of personal data

Any information pertaining to the data subject which reveals any of the below categories:

racial or ethnic origin

political opinions

religious or philosophical beliefs

trade union membership

genetic and biometric data when meant to uniquely identify someone

physical or mental health conditions

an individual's sex life or sexual orientation

The processing of these categories of data is
prohibited, unless one of the exceptions of
art. 9 applies.
For example, an exception applies when:

\begin{verbatim}
<ul>
    <li>the data subject has provided explicit consent to process these data for a specific purpose</li>
    <li>the data subject has made the data publicly available themselves </li>
    <li>processing is necessary for scientific archiving purposes</li>
  </ul><p>Contact 
  your <a href="https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/contact-privacy" target="_blank">privacy officer</a> 
  if you wish to process special categories of personal data.</p>
