The Data Privacy Handbook is a guide on handling personal data in scientific 
research, in line with European data protection and privacy regulations. It 
consists of:

- A **knowledge base** which explains how the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming)  applies to scientific research, including guidelines and good practices in carrying out GDPR-compliant scientific research; 
- An overview of privacy-enhancing **techniques & tools** and practical guidance on their implementation;
- **Use Cases** in the form of research projects with privacy-related issues, for which a reusable solution (e.g., tool, workflow) has been developed. 

The Data Privacy Handbook synthesizes information across various sources and 
presents it a *practical* and *actionable* format. This includes workflows, 
tools, and practical translations of the GDPR , which could be used by researchers 
and (data) support staff within Utrecht University and beyond. 

This is an Utrecht University (UU) community-driven, open-source project.

The Data Privacy Handbook is an initiative of 
<a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management" target="_blank">Research Data Management Support</a> 
at the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/university-library"  target="_blank">Utrecht University Library</a>, 
in collaboration with privacy and data experts at Utrecht University. It is part of a larger Data Privacy Project, 
that aims to develop knowledge, tools, and experience on how researchers can and 
should deal with personal data. This project is funded by the Utrecht University 
Research IT Program and an NWO Digital Competence Center grant. You can read more 
about the Data Privacy Project <a href="https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject" target="_blank">here</a>.


## How to use this Handbook

The Data Privacy Handbook aims to make knowledge and solutions on handling personal 
data *Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable* (FAIR) and present them in 
a practical and actionable format.   

The Handbook need not be read like a textbook. You are invited to navigate to the 
topic you need based on the table of contents, or use the guide below.
