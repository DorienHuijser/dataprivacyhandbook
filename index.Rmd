The Data Privacy Handbook is a living guide to handling personal data in scientific research, in line with European data protection and privacy regulations. It is a creation of Utrecht University Research Data Management Support in collaboration with central and faculty data support professionals, and with input from researchers at Utrecht University. 
The Data Privacy Handbook consists of:
•	a **knowledge base**, which serves to introduce readers to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), explain how it applies to scientific research, and describe how scientific research can be carried out in a GDPR-compliant manner;
•	an overview of privacy-enhancing **techniques & tools**, which introduces readers to privacy-enchancing techniques such as anonymization and pseudonymization, and illustrates how these techniques can be implemented with available developed tools;
•	**use cases**, which are featured as practical examples to draw inspiration from.
The Data Privacy Handbook is part of a larger Data Privacy Project, that aims to develop knowledge, tools, and experience of how researchers can and should deal with personal data. You can read more about the project <a href=”https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject” target="_blank">here</a>.

## How to use this Handbook

The Data Privacy Handbook is not meant to be read like a textbook. Our goal is to make knowledge and solutions surrounding this topic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and present them in a practical format. The chapters therefore do not need be read in a linear fashion. You are encouraged to navigate to the chapter you need at a given moment.

•	We can also use Twine (text-based story, like the MRI data sharing guide) and copy or embed the html file created there, we just need to test whether hyperlinks to chapters works
