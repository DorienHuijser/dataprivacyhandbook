alpha: |
  The threshold chosen in Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing to distinguish test results that lead to the decision to reject the null hypothesis, or not, based on the desired upper bound of the Type 1 error rate. An alpha level of 5% it most commonly used, but other alpha levels can be used as long as they are determined and preregistered by the researcher before the data is analyzed.
p-value: |
  The probability of the observed data, or more extreme data, if the null hypothesis is true. The lower the p-value, the higher the test statistic, and less likely it is to observe the data if the null hypothesis is true.
multi-paragraph: |
  Here's a multi-paragraph definition.
  Make sure the definition is just always indented with 2 spaces.
  Definitions are not case-sensitive.
  If you include a colon, you should use ''.
  If you use on-click, at the moment no line-breaks are allowed. This will be fixed in the code hopefully!
