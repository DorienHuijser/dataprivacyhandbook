Research projects typically go through a number of stages: conception, proposal, 
planning, execution, publishing, preservation, etc. If you work with personal 
data, you should think about how you will protect those data throughout all 
those stages. To do so, the concepts of Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default 
([art. 25](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-25-gdpr/){target="_blank"}) are 
important:

- **Privacy by Design** in research means that your project integrates personal 
data protection right from the beginning, all the way throughout the project, 
and even afterwards. It should not be an afterthought: Privacy by Design is a 
key feature of the project, permeating all phases of a research project.
- **Privacy by Default** in research means that any questions, tools, or methods 
you use in your research should process as little personal data as necessary by 
default, and that you share the personal data only with those who really need 
access.

To get proper support in designing your project, it is important to contact your 
[privacy officer](#support) early on, preferably already in the conception or design phase. The privacy 
officer will help you go through the different stages smoothly, and eventually 
save you time and effort. They can help you review and possibly adjust your 
plans, determine the appropriate protection measures, and determine whether you 
need to perform a more elaborate [Data Protection Impact Assessment](#dpia).

From Conception (Hypothesis generation, ideas), to Designing the project (Grant/project proposal, Draft privacy scan, Consult with privacy officer, data manager, grant officer), to Grant/project approved (Privacy scan, possibly DPIA, Data Management Plan, Privacy notice and consent form, Ethics review, Agreements between parties) to Data acquisition (Data collection and reuse), Data Processing (Preprocessing, Analysis, Output generation), to Preservation (of data, code and documentation) and Publication (Manuscript, Data, Code and Documentation)](img/privacy-research-cycle.png "Privacy in the research cycle: a good preparation is crucial")

To incorporate the concepts of Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default into 
your project, the approach of **privacy design strategies** 
([Hoepman, 2022](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/publications/pds-booklet.pdf){target="_blank"}) 
offers a way to make the GDPR principles more concrete. Hoepman distinguishes 8 
strategies that you can apply to protect the personal data in your research: 
minimise, separate, abstract, hide, inform, control, enforce, and demonstrate. 
Below, we explain what these mean and how you can apply them. 

:::fyi
The GDPR does not prescribe *which* specific measures you should apply in your 
project, only that they should protect the personal data *effectively*. Which 
measures will be effective, will depend on your specific project, the risks for 
data subjects, and the current progress in technology (i.e. will the data be 
protected on the long haul?). So make sure that your protective measures are
up-to-date as well!

#### <img src="img/minimise.svg" alt="minimise icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Minimise 
Limit as much as possible the processing of personal data, for example by:

- Collecting as little data as possible to reach your research purpose.
- Collecting only personal data from the amount of individuals necessary.
- Preferably not using tools that automatically collect unnecessary personal 
data. If possible, prevent tools you do use from doing so (Privacy by Default).
For example, the survey tool Qualtrics can automatically register location data,
which can be turned off by using the
"[Anonymize Responses](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-options/survey-protection/#AnonymizingResponses){target="_blank"}" 
option.
- Removing personal data when you no longer need them. Remove them from 
repositories, data collection tools, sent emails, back-ups, etc. (see also the 
[Storage chapter](#data-storage)). Use directly identifying 
information only if you legitimately need them, for example to keep in touch
with data subjects or to answer your research question.
- [Pseudonymising or anonymising](#pseudonymisation-anonymisation) personal 
data as early as possible.
- Use portable storage media only temporarily.

#### <img src="img/separate.svg" alt="separate icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Separate
Separate the processing of different types of personal data as much as possible, 
for example by:

- Storing directly identifying personal data (e.g., contact information) 
separately from the research data. Use identification keys to link both datasets, 
and store these keys also separately from the research data.
- Separating access to different types of personal data. For example, separate
who has access to contact information vs. to the research data.
- Applying [secure computation](#secure-computation) techniques, where 
the data remain at a central location and do not have to be moved for the analysis.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

#### <img src="img/abstract.svg" alt="abtract icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Abstract
Limit as much and as early on as possible the detail in which personal data 
are processed, for example by:

- [Pseudonymising or anonymising](#pseudonymisation-anonymisation) the data.
- Adding noise to the data, e.g., voice alteration in audio data.
- Summarising the data to simply describe general trends instead of individual 
data points.
- [Synthesising](#synthetic-data) the data, e.g., for sharing trends 
in the data without revealing individual data points.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

#### <img src="img/hide.svg" alt="hide icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Hide
Protect personal data, or make them unlinkable or unobservable. Make sure they 
do not become public or known. You can for example do so using a combination of:

- Using [encryption](#encryption), [hashing](#pseudonymisation-anonymisation) or 
[strong passwords](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/it-facilities/information-security/information-security-secure-access-choosing-a-secure-password){target="_blank"}
to protect data. Consider using a password manager to avoid losing access to the 
data.
- Using secure internet connections and encrypted transport protocols (such as 
TLS, SFTP, HTTPS, etc.). Do not connect to public WiFi on devices containing 
personal data.
- Applying privacy models like [Differential privacy](#differential-privacy),
where noise is added to individual data points to hide their true identity.
- Only providing access to people who really need it, and only for the necessary 
amount of time and with the necessary authorisations (e.g., read vs. write 
access; only the relevant selection of personal data, etc.). Remove 
authorisations when access is no longer required.
- Encrypting and regularly backing up data on portable storage media.
- Keeping a clear desk policy: lock your screen and store paper behind lock and 
key when you leave your desk.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

#### <img src="img/info.svg" alt="inform icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Inform
Inform data subjects about the processing of their personal data in a timely 
and adequate manner, for example by:

- Providing information via an 
[information letter or privacy notice](#privacy-notices) on a project website.
- Providing verbal explanation before an interview. 
- Obtaining explicit consent via an informed consent procedure.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

### <img src="img/control.svg" alt="control icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Control
Give data subjects adequate control over the processing of their personal data, 
for example by:

- Specifying a procedure and responsible person in case data subjects want to 
exercise their [data subject rights](#data-subject-rights).
- Providing data subjects with a contact point (e.g., email address) for 
questions and exercising their data subject rights.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

### <img src="img/enforce.svg" alt="enforce icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Enforce
Commit to processing personal data in a privacy-friendly way, and adequately 
enforce this, for example by:

- Using only [Utrecht University-approved tools](https://tools.uu.nl/){target="_blank"} 
to collect, [store](#data-storage), analyse and [share](#data-sharing-collaboration)
personal data. 
- Entering into [agreements](#agreements) with third parties if they 
are working with UU-controlled personal data. Such agreements will make sure 
everyone will treat the data up to UU-standards.
- Always keeping your software up-to-date and using a virus scanner on your devices. 
- Appointing someone responsible for regulating access to the data.
- Always reporting (suspicions of) 
[data breaches](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/what-is-a-personal-data-breach){target="_blank"}. 
At UU, contact the [Computer Emergency Response Team](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/security/information-security-computer-misuse-or-report-incident-cert){target="_blank"}. 
- If needed, drawing up a privacy and/or security policy that specify roles and 
responsibilities and best practices on how personal data are handled throughout 
a project. 
- Using a Trusted Third Party when linking individual data from different 
sources together.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

### <img src="img/demonstrate.svg" alt="demonstrate icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Demonstrate
Demonstrate you are processing personal data in a privacy-friendly way, for 
example by:

- Registering your research project in the UU processing register (once available).
- Performing a [Privacy Scan](#privacy-scan) and storing it alongside the personal data.
- Performing a [Data Protection Impact Assessment](#dpia) (DPIA)</a> for 
projects that have a high privacy risk for the data subjects.
- Keeping information for data subjects and (signed) informed consent forms on 
file. This is not needed if you can fully anonymise the data: then you should 
delete the (signed) consent forms as well.
