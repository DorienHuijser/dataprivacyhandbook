This chapter addresses guidelines to take into account when you want to share 
personal data with collaborators outside of your own institution **during** 
your research project. For guidelines to share personal data after a research 
project, please refer to the chapter on 
<a href="#data-sharing-reuse">Data sharing for reuse</a>. 

To be able to share personal data with external collaborators, you should:  


<details open="true"><summary><b>1. Make sure you have a legal basis and 
inform data subjects</b></summary>
  <div><ul>
      <li>Make sure data subjects are well-informed about your intentions to 
      share the data with collaborators. Include information in your 
      <a href="#privacy-notices">privacy notice</a> on the identity of your 
      collaborators, which data are shared with them and why, how, and for how 
      long. Avoid using statements that preclude sharing such as "Your data 
      will not be shared with anyone else".</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a <a href="#legal-basis">legal basis</a> to 
      share the data, e.g., informed consent or public interest. If you use 
      consent, make sure that data subjects are aware that they are also 
      providing consent to share their data with your collaborators.</li>
      <li>Inform data subjects timely - <b>before</b> you start processing 
      their data - and <b>proactively</b> - directly if possible.</li>

      data and the measures you will take to mitigate those in your

      or if applicable, <a href="#dpia">Data Protection Impact Assessment</a>. 
      This is especially important if you will share your data with 
      collaborators outside of the European Economic Area.</li>
      <li>Share only the data that the collaborator needs (data minimisation), 
      for example by deleting unnecessary data, pseudonymising the data, and 
      sharing only with those who need access to the data.</li>
      <li>Make sure data subjects can still exercise their 
      <a href="#data-subject-rights">data subjects' rights</a>. For example, 
      if a data subject withdraws their consent, not only you, but also your 
      collaborators will have to stop processing the data subject’s personal 
      data. It is important to make clear how you and them will do so.</li>

<details><summary><b>3. Come to agreements with collaborators</b></summary>
<div><p>In order to protect the personal data effectively, it is important to 
    determine which role every collaborator has: 
    <a href="#definitions">controller or processor</a>? And if there are 
    multiple controllers, are they separate or joint controllers? For example, 
    in many collaborative research projects (e.g., in consortia), there are 
    multiple controllers that collectively determine why (e.g., research 
    question) and how (e.g., methods) to process personal data. These parties 
    are then joint controllers, and agreements need to be made in a 
    <a href="#joint-controllers-agreement">joint controllers agreement</a>.</p><p>In any collaboration in which data are shared, you need to (<a href = "https://gdpr-info.eu/art-26-gdpr/" target = "_blank">art. 26</a>):</p><ul><li>Come to a formal agreement on:
        <ul><li>The role of each party in the research project</li><li>Respective responsibilities in terms of data protection, such as informing data subjects and handling requests relating to data subjects' rights</li><li>Who is the main point of contact for data subjects</li> </ul><li>Communicate (the essence of) the agreement to data subjects.</li></ul>
  <p>Your 
  <a href = "https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/contact-privacy" target = "_blank">privacy officer</a> 
  can help you draw up a valid agreement.</p>

<details><summary><b>4. Pay special attention to third-country transfers</b></summary>
<div><p>
      If you share personal data with international collaborators (for example, 
      with countries that have no 
      <a href = "https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" target = "_blank">adequacy decision</a>), 
      you may need to take additional measures. Usually, these measures include 
      drawing up an agreement to make sure the other party is GDPR-compliant and 
      uses the necessary security measures (if you haven’t already done so). The 
      exact type of agreement will depend on your specific situation: your 
      <a href = "https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/contact-privacy" target = "_blank">privacy officer</a> 
      can help you choose and set up the right one.
    </p><p>The flowchart below indicates conditions under which you can share data 
      internationally. Note that they assume that you have taken sufficient 
      safeguards to protect the personal data. To determine the possibilities 
      of sharing data internationally in your project, we strongly advise you 
      to consult with your <a href = "https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/contact-privacy" target = "_blank">privacy officer</a>. In some cases a <a href="#dtia">Data Transfer Impact Assessment</a> may 
      be required, which can take some effort.</p><img src="img/international-data-transfer.png" alt="Flowchart about 
      international data transfers. If you are transfering data to countries 
      within the European Economic Area, no additional measures are required. If 
      you however transfer data outside of the European Economic Area, we 
      recommend to contact your faculty privacy officer to take the proper 
      measures.">

<details><summary><b>5. Use a secure way to share the data</b></summary>
<div><ul>
  <li><b>Granting access</b>: It is preferable to grant a user access 
          to an existing and safe infrastructure (e.g., add someone to a Yoda 
          group or OneDrive folder), rather than physically sending the data 
          elsewhere. This allows you to keep the data in one place, define 
          specific access rights (read/write), have users authenticate, and 
          easily revoke access to the data after your collaboration has ended. 
          It is also a good idea to take measures to prevent the data from 
          being copied elsewhere.</li><li><b>Transferring data</b>: When it is absolutely necessary to 
          transfer the files to a different location, you must do so securely.
