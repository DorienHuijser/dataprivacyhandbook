# (PART\*) Use Cases

# Publishing metadata {#open-science-questionnaire}

In 2020, the 
<a href = "https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science" target = "_blank">Open 
Science Programme of Utrecht University</a> sent out the first 
Open Science monitor. The aim was to gain insights into the awareness, 
attitudes, practices, opportunities and barriers of employees of Utrecht 
University and Utrecht University Medical Center regarding several Open 
Science practices. As the dataset contained a lot of demographic information 
(e.g., gender, age, nationality, position, type of contract, etc.), and all of 
those variables combined could lead to identification, it could not be shared 
publicly. For this particular dataset, full anonymisation was not desirable, 
as that would greatly decrease its scientific value. Therefore, the Open Science 
Programme chose to publish only the metadata and documentation, without sharing 
the data, in order to protect participants’ data while still complying with the
<a href = "https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/guides/how-to-make-your-data-fair" target = "_blank">FAIR principles</a>. 

Here’s the strategy they took:

- They published the dataset under 
<a href = "https://doi.org/10.24416/UU01-3L9K99" target = "_blank">restricted 
access on Yoda</a>, so that the dataset was at least Findable and Accessible.
- They shared other relevant documentation publicly:
  - The <a href = "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5727106" target = "_blank">preregistration</a>.
  - The <a href = "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5727057" target = "_blank">questionnaire itself</a>, 
  including the information provided to participants.
  - The <a href = "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5725177" target = "_blank">final report</a> 
  written about the dataset.

Note that in the metadata of all these publications, cross-references to the 
other publications are included to allow for maximum findability of the 
project’s outputs.

# Data pseudonymisation {#youth-pseudonymisation}

# Data minimisation in a survey {#pet-survey}

For a course, a teacher at the faculty of Veterinary Medicine collected data on 
the health of pets and the pets’ owners. The initial purpose of the survey was 
to create simply datasets for students to learn about statistics. However, 
besides for the course, the teacher also wanted to use the collected data for 
research purposes and share the data with others. In order to do so, the teacher 
created a new version of the survey that asked for less identifiable information 
and could be more easily anonymised. Additionally, the new version of the survey 
informed participants about the legal basis used to process their personal data. 

Here, you can find the survey before and after data minimisation:

<a href="assets/Use-case-minimisation-After.pdf" target = "_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><button type="button">After minimisation</button></a>

Note that the new version of the survey:

- minimises the amount of personal data collected:
  - Student number and pet names are not asked in the new version of the survey.
  - Instead of Age, the new version asks the Age category of  the owner/caretaker.
  - The survey includes questions on Weight and Height. For data publication, 
  they are used to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and deleted after this 
  calculation.
- contains information about the legal basis used to be able to use (legitimate 
interest) and publish (consent) the data for purposes other than education.
