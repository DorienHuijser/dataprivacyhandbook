# What are personal data? {#personal-data}

In order to know whether you should comply with the GDPR in your research 
project, the first question to answer is: do you process personal data? To 
answer this question, we need to know: (1) What exactly are personal data, 
and (2) how do you know if you are working with personal data in your research?

## Definition of personal data {#definition-personal-data}

According to the GDPR, personal data are “any information relating to an 
identified or identifiable natural person” 
(<a href = "https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/" target = "_blank">art.4(1)</a>):

- **Natural person**: Data by themselves (numbers, text, pictures, audio, etc.) 
are not inherently personal. They only become personal when they refer to or 
relate to a **living individual**. When data refer to an organisation, 
deceased person, or group of individuals, they are not considered personal data 
under the GDPR.
- Data are personal if they **relate** to an individual. This means practically 
anything that someone is, has said or done, owns, may think, etc. 
- The person should be **identified or identifiable**. This is the case not 
only through **directly** identifying information, such as names and contact 
information, but also through **indirectly** identifying information, for 
example if you can single someone out or identify them by combining datasets 
(see the next page).

## How to assess whether data contain personal data? {#personal-data-assess}

Whether your data contain personal data depends on which data you are 
collecting (nature) and under which circumstances (context). A date like 
“12 December 1980”, is not personal data – it is just a date. However, that 
date becomes personal data if it refers to someone’s birthday.  

In assessing whether data are personal, you should take into account all the 
means that you and others may **reasonably likely** use to identify your data 
subjects, such as the required money, time, or (future) developments in 
technology (<a href = "https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/" target = "_blank">rec. 26</a>).  

Data can be identifiable when:

- They contain **directly identifying information**.<br>
<details><summary><i>Examples (click to expand)</i></summary>
  name, image, video recording, audio recording, patient number, IP address, 
  email address, phone number, location data, social media data
  <br><br>
</details>
- It is possible to **single out** an individual, for example when there are 
unique data points or unique behavioural patterns which can only apply to one 
person.<br>
<details><summary><i>Examples</i></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>You have a data subject who is 2.10 meters tall. If this is a unique 
    value in your dataset, this distinguishes this person from others and thus 
    can make them identifiable.</li>
    <li>You have a data subject who only follows far-right accounts on Twitter. 
    If they are the only one in your dataset who do so, this distinguishes this 
    person from others and can make them identifiable.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
</details>
- It is possible to **infer information** about an individual based on information
in your dataset.<br>
<details><summary><i>Examples</i></summary>
<ul>
  <li>Inferring a medical condition based on registered medications.</li>
  <li>Guessing that someone lives in a certain neighborhood based on where they go to school.</li>
</ul>
<br>
</details>
- It is possible to **link records** relating to an individual. This can happen 
when combining multiple variables within your dataset (e.g., demographic 
information, indirect identifiers). However, it can also happen when combining 
your dataset with other datasets (the “Mosaic effect”). In that case, your data 
still contain personal data, even if the data in your dataset are not 
identifiable by themselves.<br>
<details><summary><i>Examples</i></summary>
  Linkage is often possible with demographic information (age, 
  gender, country of origin, education, workplace information, etc.) and 
  indirect identifiers (pseudonyms, device ID, etc.), for example:
  <ul>
    <li>In the year 2000, <a href = "https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf"target = "_blank">87% of the United States population</a> 
    was found to be identifiable using a combination of their ZIP code, gender 
    and date of birth.</li>
    <li>An agricultural company’s Uniek Bedrijfsnummer (UBN) can be used to 
    search for the address of the company in the 
    <a href = "https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/identificatie-en-registratie-dieren/app-ir-dieren" target = "_blank">I&R mobile app</a>. 
    Often, this address is also the owner’s home address.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
</details>
- De-identification is still **reversible**. This often happens when data are 
pseudonymised, but there is still a way to link the pseudonymised data with 
identifiable data, for example when a name-pseudonym key still exists.

:::fyi
You can assume that you are processing personal data when you collect data 
**directly** from people, even if the results of that collection are anonymous. But 
also when you use data that are **observed or derived from people**, even if those
data were previously collected, made public or used for non-research purposes.
:::

In short, even if you cannot find out someone’s real identity (name, address), 
the data you process can still contain personal data under the GDPR. Besides 
the examples mentioned here, there are many 
<a href = "https://intranet.uu.nl/system/files/documenten/categories-of-personal-information-en.pdf" target = "_blank">other examples of personal data</a>. If you need help assessing whether or not your 
data contain personal data, please contact your 
<a href = "https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/contact-privacy" target = "_blank">privacy officer</a> 
or data manager.

## Special types of personal data {#special-types-personal-data}
There are a few special types of personal data that are worth taking note of: 
special categories of personal data, and otherwise sensitive personal data. 
These types of personal data have additional requirements. If you want to 
process them, please contact your 
<a href = "https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/contact-privacy" target = "_blank">privacy officer</a> 
first.

### Special categories of personal data
The GDPR explicitly defines seven ‘special categories of personal data’. It is 
information that reveals:

- racial or ethnic origin
- political opinions
- religious or philosophical beliefs
- trade union membership
- genetic or biometric data when meant to uniquely identify someone
- physical or mental health conditions
- sex life or sexual orientation

It is in principle **prohibited** to process these types of personal data, 
unless an exception applies 
(<a href = "https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/" target = "_blank">art.9</a>). For 
example, it is allowed to process these if:

- Data subjects have provided explicit consent to process these data for a 
specific purpose
- Data subjects have made the data publicly available themselves
- Processing is necessary for scientific research purposes (incl. historical 
and statistical purposes)

Even if you can make use of one of these exemptions, special categories of 
personal data warrant additional security measures to make sure they are 
protected. Always contact your 
<a href = "https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/contact-privacy" target = "_blank">privacy officer</a> 
if you intend on processing these types of data.

### Data that are otherwise sensitive
Other types of data can also be sensitive, because they can carry higher risks 
for the data subjects. These types of data can either not be processed at all, 
or only under certain circumstances. Either way, they require additional 
security measures. Always contact your 
<a href = "https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/contact-privacy" target = "_blank">privacy officer</a> 
if you intend on using these types of data.

Examples are:

- Financial data
- Data about relationship problems
- Data that can be misused for identity fraud, such as the Dutch Citizen 
Service Number (BSN). In principle, the BSN cannot be used in research at all.
- Criminal or justice-related data: they can only be processed under 
governmental supervision or when a derogation exists in national legislation 
(<a href = "https://gdpr-info.eu/art-10-gdpr/" target = "_blank">art. 10</a>).
