In the below Zotero library, you can find a list of resources that may be 
interesting to check out if you want to read further. You can look in the 
folders, but also click a tag depending on the topic you are interested in.

```{r embedzotero, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.zotero.org/groups/2554340/data_privacy_uu/library",
                   height = "600px")
```
