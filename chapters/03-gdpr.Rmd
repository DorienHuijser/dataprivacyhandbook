# The GDPR {#gdpr .unnumbered}

**This chapter will present the most important definitions, principles and rights 
of data subjects outlined in the GDPR and how it applies to your research. Most 
of the practical advice that we provide in this Handbook will be rooted in and 
builds on the concepts presented here.**

### Chapter summary

The GDPR is a EU-wide regulation that controls the processing of personal data. 
If you process personal data, you should:

- Make sure you have a [legal basis](#legal-basis) to process the 
data. In research, this is often informed consent. 
- Be transparent and fair towards data subjects. 
- Be specific in which personal data you process and for what purposes. Limit 
the amount of data you process to what is necessary, and only store the data
for that necessary amount of time.
- Protect the confidentiality of the data by incorporating
[privacy by design](#privacy-by-design) into your project from the start.
- Make sure your data subjects can exercise their 
[data subjects' rights](#data-subject-rights), and they know how to do so.

## What is the GDPR? {#what-is-the-gdpr}

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Dutch: *Algemene Verordening 
Gegevensbescherming* [AVG]) is an EU-wide regulation meant to protect the privacy 
of individuals within a rapidly growing technological society. The GDPR facilitates 
the free movement of personal data within the European Economic Area (EEA). Its 
data processing principles are meant to ensure a fair balance between competing 
interests -- for example, the right to conduct research vs. the right to protect 
personal data (Articles 13 and 8, from the Charter of Fundamental right of the EU).

#### The GDPR in a nutshell {#the-gdpr-in-a-nutshell}

All articles and recitals of the GDPR can be found online via <https://gdpr-info.eu/>. 
The [video below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzhsHuuCX6w){target="_blank"} 
highlights some important aspects of the GDPR:

  <div><small> The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates what we can 
  and cannot do with personal data such as a person's name, sexual orientation, 
  home address and health. This also applies to personal data used in research 
  and education. The regulation consists of 88 pages. Fortunately, the basics 
  are easy to remember in 3 steps:
  <ol>
    <li>
      First, there must be a clear legal basis for processing personal data. This can 
      include consent, a legal obligation, or public interest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Second, appropriate technical and organisational measures must be taken 
      while processing personal data to ensure maximum privacy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lastly, the persons whose data you have collected must always have the 
      option of inspecting, changing, or removing their personal data.
    </li>
  </ol>
That is the GDPR in a nutshell. 
</small></div>
</details>

#### When does the GDPR apply? {#gdpr-scope}

The GDPR has been applicable from May 2018 onward and applies when:

- you are processing [personal data](#personal-data)
(material scope, [art 2](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-2-gdpr/){target="_blank"}).
- the controller or processor of the data *resides* in the EEA (territorial 
scope, [art. 3](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-3-gdpr/){target="_blank"}).
This is independent of whether the actual processing takes place in the EEA. 
In some cases, the GDPR also applies when the controller or processor is not
established in the EEA, but is processing data from EU citizens.

:::warning
If you are collecting or using data that originated from individuals (or is 
related to individuals), it is very likely that the GDPR applies to your project.
You can read more in the chapter [What are personal data?](#personal-data).
:::

#### Implementation {#implementation}

While the GDPR is a regulation for the entire EEA, each EEA country can additionally 
implement further restrictions and guidelines in national implementation laws. The 
Dutch implementation law is called 
"[Uitvoeringswet AVG (UAVG)](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940/2021-07-01"){target="_blank"}". 
The UAVG determines, for example, that it is forbidden to process Citizen 
Service Numbers (BSN), unless it is for purposes determined by a law or a 
General Administrative Order (AMvB).

**The GDPR has a number of principles at its core which dictate the (method of) 
data processing. Every type of processing has to comply with these principles. 
Understanding these principles is the first step to determining what type of 
personal data can be collected and how they can processed.**

The GDPR principles are explained further below the image. The 
[Design chapter](#privacy-by-design) describes how to implement these principles 
in your research. You can also always contact your [privacy officer](#support).

![Overview of the principles, denoted in text on a yellow background, with an icon that visualises each principle: Lawful, fair and transparent, Purpose limitation, Data minimisation, Accuracy, Storage limitation, Integrity and Confidentiality, and Accountability](img/gdpr-principles.png "The key principles of the GDPR")

#### 1. Lawful, fair and transparent

When working with personal data, your processing should be:

<ol>
  <li><details><summary><b>Lawful</b></summary>
  <div>Make sure all your processing activities (e.g., data collection, storage, 
  analysis, sharing) have a [legal basis](#legal-basis). Ideally, 
  you should have determined your processing purposes (e.g., research questions) 
  in advance.<br></div>
  </details></li>
  <li><details><summary><b>Fair</b></summary>
  <div><ul>
    <li>Consider the broad effects of your processing on the rights and dignity of the data subject.</li>
    <li>Give data subjects the possibility to exercise [their rights](#data-subject-rights).</li>
    <li>Avoid deception in the communication with data subjects: processing of personal data should be in line with what they can expect.</li>
    <li>The processing of personal data should not have a disproportionate negative, unlawful, discriminating or misleading effect on data subjects.</li>
  </ul><br>
  </div></details>
  </li>
  <li><details><summary><b>Transparent</b></summary>
  <div>Be transparent in the [communication to your data subjects](#privacy-notices) 
  about who is processing the personal data (controllers, processors), which 
  personal data are  processed, as well as why and for how long, and how data 
  subjects can exercise their rights. The information provided should be 
  unambiguous, concise, easily accessible and relevant and shared with data 
  subjects <i>before</i> the start of your research.
  </div></details></li>
</ol>

#### 2. Purpose limitation

You can only process (i.e., collect, analyse, store, share, etc.) personal data 
for a specific purpose and only for as long as necessary to complete that purpose. 
For example, if you communicated to data subjects that you would use their 
personal data only to answer your specific research question, you cannot further 
share the personal data for new research questions, as these would be additional 
processing purposes. This means that you need to **plan what you will do with 
the (collected) personal data in advance and stick to that plan in order to be 
GDPR-compliant**.

#### 3. Data minimisation

You can only process the personal data you need to for your predefined purpose(s), 
and not more just because they may "come in handy later". This principle makes 
sure that, for example, in the event of a data breach, the amount of data exposed 
is kept to a minimum.

#### 4. Accuracy

The accuracy of personal data is integral to data protection. Inaccurate data 
can be a risk for data subjects, for example when they lead to a wrong treatment 
in a medical trial. You therefore need to take every reasonable step to remove 
or rectify data that is inaccurate or incomplete. Moreover, data subjects have 
the [right](#data-subject-rights) to request that inaccurate or 
incomplete data be removed or rectified within 30 days.

#### 5. Storage limitation

You can only [store personal data](#data-storage) for as long as is 
necessary to achieve your (research) purpose. Afterwards, they need to be 
removed. If the personal data are part of your research data (and not, for 
example, to simply contact data subjects), you are allowed to store (archive) 
them for a longer period of time, provided necessary safeguards are in place. 
This is an exemption that applies to data storage for scientific archiving 
purposes. You need to inform the data subjects on this storage duration beforehand.

:::fyi
If identification of the data subject is no longer needed for your 
(research) purposes, you do not need to keep storing the personal data just 
to comply with the GDPR, even if it means your data subjects cannot exercise 
their rights ([art. 11](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/){target="_blank"}).
:::

#### 6. Integrity and confidentiality

You have to process personal data securely and protect against unauthorised 
processing or access, loss or damage. To this end, you should put in place 
apropriate [organisational and technical measures](#privacy-by-design).

#### 7. Accountability

The controller is ultimately responsible for demonstrating GDPR-compliance. As a 
researcher working with personal data, you are representing your institution 
(e.g., Utrecht University) and you should therefore be able to demonstrate that 
you process personal data in a compliant manner. Additionally, you should also 
have some knowledge of data protection so that you can implement the right 
measures into your research project.

## Legal bases for working with personal data {#legal-basis}

:::keywords
On this page: legal basis, legal ground, consent, public interest, legitimate
interest, secondary use    
Date of last review: 2023-07-11
:::

You can only process personal data if you have a **legal basis** to do so, which 
should be registered, among other information, in the 
[processing register](#processing-register) and 
[communicated to data subjects](#privacy-notices). There are 6 possible 
legal bases which are outlined below. In research, the legal bases 'informed 
consent', 'public interest' and to some extent 'legitimate interests of the 
controller' are most often used.

:::fyi
**For different purposes in your research project, a different 
legal basis may apply**. For example, you may contact data subjects before they 
start participating based on a legitimate interest and use informed consent for 
collecting, storing, analysing and publishing the data.
:::

### Legal bases suitable for research

<ol>
  <li>
    <details open="true">
      <summary><b>Informed consent</b></summary>
      <div>Informed consent is the most frequently used legal basis in research and 
        is often not only a legal (GDPR-consent), but also an ethical obligation 
        (e.g., METC informed consent). When using informed consent, you should 
        be able to demonstrate that the data subject was informed and has given 
        consent, and for which purpose(s) they gave their consent. In all cases, 
        consent has to be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. Please 
        refer to the [Informed consent section](#informed-consent-forms) for 
        guidance on applying informed consent in your research.</div>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Public interest</b></summary>
      <div><p>
        Public interest is sometimes used in research when the research is shown
        to clearly benefit the public good or fulfills a public task. In 
        essence, public interest can be used for research that is conducted by 
        employees of public institutions, when their research interest has been 
        recognised by an official authority. For example, conducting research at 
        Dutch universities has been officially recognised in the 
        [Higher Education and Scientific Research Act](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/2022-01-01){target="_blank"}
        to be a public task. Public interest is often used when consent is not 
        a good option. For example, it may be impossible or impractical to 
        obtain consent when performing public observations or social media 
        research. Or when participants actually do not have a free choice, such 
        as in clinical trials when participants would experience significant 
        disadvantages when not participating.
      </p><p>If you want to use public interest as a legal basis, you 
        need to assess the necessity and proportionality of your processing. 
        Additionally, you need to demonstrate that the interests of data 
        subjects do not override your research interests. To do so, please contact 
        your [privacy officer](#support) to assess whether you can use this 
        legal basis in your research.</p></div>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Legitimate interest of the controller</b></summary>
      <div><p>
        Legitimate interest is often used by companies to process personal data 
        necessary for the functioning of their own company, e.g., processing 
        user data for fraud prevention, or keeping a registration system to 
        provide better services. In research, legitimate interest is often used 
        for processing activities that have no direct research purpose. For 
        example, this can be the case when you need to collect contact 
        information to approach data subjects to participate, and you can only 
        obtain their consent for participating in your research after contacting 
        them. Since contacting data subjects is a prerequisite to perform your 
        research, it can be in the university's legitimate (research) interest 
        to process their contact information.
      </p><p>To evaluate whether you can use legitimate interest as a legal basis, you 
        always need to weigh the interests of the controller (e.g., Utrecht 
        University) and the data subjects in a 
        [Legitimate interest assessment](#legitimate-interest-assessment).
        Please contact your [privacy officer](#support) to assess whether you 
        can use this legal basis in your research.</p></div>
    </details>
  </li>
</ol>

### Legal bases not suitable for reseach

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Processing is necessary because of a legal obligation of the controller</b></summary>
      <div>This basis is not suitable for research. As an example, Utrecht 
        University has to share tax data with the Dutch tax administration in 
        order to comply with tax legislation.</div>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract</b></summary>
      <div>This basis is not suitable for research. As an example, Utrecht 
        University has contracts with its employees, which require it to manage 
        the employees' financial data.</div>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Processing is necessary to protect a person's vital interests</b></summary>
      <div>This basis is generally not suitable for research. If processing 
        someone's personal data is crucial to their health or even life, that 
        processing is allowed under the GDPR.</div>
    </details>
  </li>
</ol>


### Further processing for research purposes {#further-processing}

It may happen that you want to process personal data for other purposes than 
previously specified (e.g., because you formulated an additional research 
question), or you want to reuse previously collected personal data in your 
research. In these cases, it may be possible to make use of 
[article 5(1)(b)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/){target="_blank"}, 
which states that "further processing for [...] scientific purposes shall [...] 
not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes". Basically, this 
means that you can reuse personal data, that were previously collected for other 
purposes, for scientific research purposes. This is only allowed if you put in 
place sufficient safeguards to protect the personal data, inform data subjects, 
and allow them to exercise their rights 
([art. 89](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-89-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
"Further processing" is not strictly a legal basis. Instead, it functions as a 
way to legitimise *further* processing of personal data (which was previously 
collected for a different purpose, using one of the six legal bases) for research 
purposes.

:::note
Public interest, legitimate interest, and relying on further processing are ways 
to meet your *legal* requirements for processing personal data, but not 
necessarily your *ethical* requirements: you may still need consent if demanded 
so from an ethical perspective. Before you rely on any of these, you should 
first assess whether they are indeed suitable with your faculty [privacy officer](#support), 
and determine whether your research interests outweigh the privacy rights of 
the data subjects.

## Data Subjects' Rights {#data-subject-rights}

:::keywords
On this page: rights of participants, right, withdrawing consent, delete data    
Date of last review: 2023-07-11
:::

The GDPR provides data subjects with several rights that gives them a relatively 
high degree of control over their own personal data. Below, we list these rights 
and how you can apply them in your research:

<ol>
  <li>
    <details open="true">
      <summary><b>Right to be informed</b></summary>
      <div>Data subjects need to be clearly informed about what you are doing with their 
      personal data (a.o. [art. 12](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
      This usually happens via an [information letter](#privacy-notices). This right 
      does not apply if your research will be seriously harmed by meeting it and if 
      you haven't obtained the personal data directly from the data subjects themselves.
    </div></details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Right of access</b></summary>
      <div>Data subjects have the right to access a copy of the personal data you have 
      on them and to know what you are doing with that personal data and why 
      ([art. 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/){target="_blank"}).
    </div></details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Right to rectification</b></summary>
      <div>Data subjects have the right to correct and complement the personal data 
      that you have of them 
      ([art. 16](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-16-gdpr/){target="_blank"}).
    </div></details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Right to erasure/Right to be forgotten</b></summary>
      <div>Data subjects have the right to have their personal data removed (i.e., 
      equivalent to the right to withdraw consent, 
      [art. 17](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
      This right does **not** need to be granted if:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the personal data are published and need to be archived for validation 
          purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          it would seriously obstruct the research purpose(s).
        </li>
        <li>
          it would hinder complying with a legal obligation or carrying out a task 
          in the public interest.
        </li>
      </ul><p>If the personal data have already been made public or shared, you need to 
      take reasonable measures to inform other users of the data of the erasure 
      request. A [privacy officer](#support) can help you with this.</p></div></details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Right to restriction of processing</b></summary>
      <div>Data subjects have the right to have you process less of their personal data 
      ([art. 18](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-18-gdpr/){target="_blank"}), 
      for example if their personal data are inaccurate or your processing of it 
      is unlawful or no longer needed.
    </div></details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Right to data portability</b></summary>
      <div>Data subjects have the right to have their personal data transferred to 
      another party in a "structured, commonly used and machine-readable format" 
      ([art. 20](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/){target="_blank"}).
    </div></details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Right to object</b></summary>
      <div>Data subjects have the right to object to what you are doing with their 
      personal data. This right applies when the processing is based on legitimate 
      or public interest ([art. 21](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
      In case of objection, you have to stop your processing activities and thus
      delete any data you have from the particular data subject, unless you can 
      demonstrate concrete grounds for overriding the data subject's rights
      (e.g., excluding the data subject would substantially bias your results).
    </div></details>
  </li>
</ol>


:::note
In Dutch scientific research, it is possible to exclude the rights of access 
([art. 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/){target="_blank"}), rectification 
([art. 16](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-16-gdpr/){target="_blank"}), and restriction 
of processing ([art. 18](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-18-gdpr/){target="_blank"}), 
so that data subjects cannot exercise those rights 
([UAVG art. 44](https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0040940&hoofdstuk=4&artikel=44&z=2021-07-01&g=2021-07-01){target="_blank"}). 
If you wish to do this, please first consult with your [privacy officer](#support).
:::

#### How can data subjects exercise their rights?

Data subjects need to be **informed** about their rights and who to contact in 
order to exercise them, including when you use a legal basis other than informed 
consent. In research, this is usually done via a 
[privacy notice or information letter](#privacy-notices), which states 
a contact person responsible for handling questions and requests.

Incoming requests need to be **coordinated with a privacy officer**, so that 
they can be picked up in accordance with the GDPR. Additionally, at Utrecht 
University, data subjects can always contact 
[privacy@uu.nl](mailto:privacy@uu.nl){.email} (Legal Affairs) for 
requests or complaints.

#### What to do when receiving a request concerning data subjects' rights?

You have to provide a substantive response to the data subject **within 30 days**, 
in the same way as you received the request. Depending on the complexity and 
number of requests, the response period may be extended by 2 months. In that 
case, you must inform the data subject about this extension (including the 
motivation) within one month. If needed, you can (and sometimes should) ask for 
additional information to confirm the data subject's identity.

For granting requests about data subjects' rights, there should be a procedure 
in place, in which you should at least consider:

- how you are going to retrieve the data (e.g., using a name-number key)
- who is responsible for granting the request and informing the data subject 
about it (e.g., a data manager)
- how the request is going to be granted, for example how they will be sent

For larger projects, it may be wise to put a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 
in place.

#### What if the data have already been anonymised?

The principles of data minimisation and storage limitation are considered more 
important than keeping personal data just for the sake of identification 
([art. 11](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
Therefore, when receiving a request about anonymised data, you can make it clear 
that you cannot retrieve the data subject's personal data, because they have 
been anonymised. In this case, **the data subject cannot exercise their rights 
anymore**. If you can still retrieve the data subject's personal data in some 
way (i.e., when data are pseudonymised), you are **obliged to retrieve them**. 
In order to do so, you can (and sometimes should) ask for additional information 
that can confirm the data subject's identity.
