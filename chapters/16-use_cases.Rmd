For a course, a teacher at the faculty of Veterinary Medicine collected data on 
the health of pets and the petsâ€™ owners. The initial purpose of the survey was 
to create simply datasets for students to learn about statistics. However, 
besides for the course, the teacher also wanted to use the collected data for 
research purposes and share the data with others. In order to do so, the teacher 
created a new version of the survey that asked for less identifiable information 
and could be more easily anonymised. Additionally, the new version of the survey 
informed participants about the legal basis used to process their personal data. 

Here, you can find the survey before and after data minimisation:

<a href="files/Use-case-minimisation-After.pdf" target = "_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><button type="button">After minimisation</button></a>

<br>
Note that the new version of the survey:

- minimises the amount of personal data collected:
  - Student number and pet names are not asked in the new version of the survey.
  - Instead of Age, the new version asks the Age category of  the owner/caretaker.
  - The survey includes questions on Weight and Height. For data publication, 
  they are used to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and deleted after this 
  calculation.
- contains information about the legal basis used to be able to use (legitimate 
interest) and publish (consent) the data for purposes other than education.

[YOUth](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/youth-cohort-study){target="_blank"} 
(Youth of Utrecht) is a longitudinal child cohort study that collects data about 
the behavioural and cognitive development of children in the Utrecht area. The 
study follows about 4000 children and their parents in two cohorts. One from 
birth until around the age of six, one from around 9-years-old until adolescence. 
YOUth collects a wide variety of data types, ranging from questionnaires to 
biological samples. Because of the large amount of data and the sensitive nature 
of the data and the participants (minors), the data can be considered as very 
sensitive, and thus should be pseudonymised where possible.

### General steps
YOUth is committed to sharing their data for reuse, and thus the datasets that 
they share should contain as little personal information as possible. For that 
purpose, the YOUth data manager implements a number of measures: 

- All data are pseudonymised as much as possible (see below). 
- Every dataset that is shared for reuse is first checked for identifiable 
information. Special category information is taken out of the datasets as much 
as possible, and no unnecessary information such as date of birth is shared. 
- Using the tool 
[AnonymoUUs](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/anonymouus){target="_blank"}, 
participant pseudonyms are replaced with artificial pseudonyms, and all 
dates with a fake date, each time a new set of data is prepared for sharing. 
This limits the ability of external researchers to link multiple requested 
datasets together and thus to form a more complete image of each participant. 
It also prevents singling out participants based on the day they visited the 
research centre.

### Pseudonymisation per data type

Below is an overview of the data types and pseudonymisation measures taken by 
the YOUth data manager. Besides these pseudonymisation measures, YOUth has 
implemented a 
[data request procedure](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/youth-cohort-study/data-access){target="_blank"} 
which delineates the conditions under which researchers can access the data, 
and the steps they have to take to request access.

<details><summary>Questionnaire data (tabular)</summary>
<div>Children and their parents/caretakers (sometimes their teacher) fill out 
several questionnaires about, among others, their mental and physical 
development, living conditions, and social environment. 

Pseudonymisation measures: 
<ul>
<li>A script removes unnecessary (special category) personal data from the 
shared dataset where possible, such as religion, ethnicity and open text 
responses.</li>
<li>If a researcher needs demographic information only to describe the sample, 
the data manager shares a frequency table of the requested information, for 
example for ethnicity and socio-economic status, instead of sharing the raw 
responses.</li>
<li>The Anonymouus tool replaces the pseudonym and date in the questionnaire 
data and file names.</li>
</ul>

In the future, the data manager would like to share only scale scores, instead of responses to individual questions in standardised questionnaires. 
</div></details>

<details><summary>Computer tasks (tabular)</summary>
<div>On a computer, children play various games to measure cognitive and motoric 
development of the child. In most games, the response times, choices and scores 
are recorded. To pseudonymise the data, the AnonymoUUs tool replaces the 
pseudonym and dates in the task data and filenames and in some cases even the 
name of the participant.</div></details>

<details><summary>Logbook- and experiment book data (tabular)</summary>
<div>Notes about data collection (data quality, task-order, if experiment 
started etc.) are made in logbooks by means of a data capturing tool. In that 
same tool, YOUth also collects research data about body measures (length, weight 
and head circumference) and intelligence (WISC and WPPSI) To pseudonymise those 
data, the AnonymoUUs tool replaces the pseudonym and date in the filenames and 
data.</div></details> 

<details><summary>Video tasks (video recording)</summary>
<div><p>During two tasks (the Hand game and the Delay of gratification task), 
children are video- and audiotaped to be able to analyse their behaviour. Parents 
may also be visible in the background, as well as a research assistant.</p>
<p>To pseudonymise these data, both the videos from the Hand game and the Delayed 
gratification task will be coded/scored on the variables of interest (e.g., does 
the child take the candy out of the bag or not). This way, no actual video 
recordings will need to be shared with other researchers.</p></div></details>

<details><summary>Parent-child interaction (video recording)</summary>
<div>Children and their parents are videotaped while they play with each other 
or discuss specific topics. Because these data are difficult to pseudonymise and 
could be scored/coded on many different aspects, YOUth provides a special local 
laboratory space to perform the desired qualitative analysis on these video 
data.</div></details> 

<details><summary>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data (3D image)</summary>
<div><p>MRI data of children are collected to study structural (3D image of the 
brain, skull, and outer layers of the head) and functional (brain activity) 
properties of the brain.</p>
<p>To pseudonymise the MRI data, structural MRI scans (DICOM) are defaced using 
<a href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_deface" target="_blank">mri_deface</a> 
(v1.22), resulting in NIfTi files. Additionally, the AnonymoUUs tool replaces 
the pseudonym in the filenames.</p></div></details>

<details><summary>Electro-encephalography (EEG) data (video and text files)</summary>
<div>A cap is placed on the child's head with electrodes attached to measure 
brain activity. The child is placed in front of a monitor and views various 
on-screen stimuli (incl. faces, objects, sounds, music, toys). A video is also 
made to check whether the child watches the screen. For the moment, the videos 
will not be shared with external researchers. In the EEG data itself, the 
AnonymoUUs tool replaces the pseudonym and date.</div></details>

<details><summary>Eye tracking data (text files)</summary> 
<div>Children are placed in front of a screen and view various stimuli (incl. 
faces, objects, sounds, music, toys), with or without an assignment. Eye 
movements and focus points are recorded using an eyetracker. To pseudonymise 
these data, the AnonymoUUs tool replaces the pseudonym and date in the 
eyetracking data and the filenames.</div></details> 

<details><summary>Ultrasound images (3D echos)</summary>
<div>During the mothers' pregnancy, 3D ultrasound images are made of foetuses 
to follow overall and brain size development. To pseudonymise these data, the 
ultrasound images (DICOM) will be converted to nifti (.nii) format, which does 
not contain header information. Additionally, the AnonymoUUs tool replaces the 
pseudonym and date in the filenames and in the SQL database that comes with the 
measurement.</div></details>

<details><summary>Biological materials</summary> 
<div>At various moments during the study, (chord) blood, hair, saliva, and 
buccal swabs are taken from the child and sometimes their parent(s). The samples 
cannot be pseudonymised, because they are physical samples. Instead, a procedure
is in place to have biological samples analysed at preferred partners, without
having to share the physical samples with researchers.</div></details>

# Publishing metadata {#open-science-questionnaire}

On this page: FAIR data, metadata, documentation, publication, reuse
::::

In 2020, the [Open Science Programme of Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science){target="_blank"}
sent out the first 
Open Science monitor. The aim was to gain insights into the awareness, 
attitudes, practices, opportunities and barriers of employees of Utrecht 
University and Utrecht University Medical Center regarding several Open 
Science practices. As the dataset contained a lot of demographic information 
(e.g., gender, age, nationality, position, type of contract, etc.), and all of 
those variables combined could lead to identification, it could not be shared 
publicly. For this particular dataset, full anonymisation was not desirable, 
as that would greatly decrease its scientific value. Therefore, the Open Science 
Programme chose to publish only the metadata and documentation, without sharing 
the data, in order to protect participantsâ€™ data while still complying with the
[FAIR principles](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/guides/how-to-make-your-data-fair){target="_blank"}. 

Hereâ€™s the strategy they took:

- They published the dataset under 
[restricted access on Yoda](https://doi.org/10.24416/UU01-3L9K99){target="_blank"}, 
so that the dataset was at least Findable and Accessible.
- They shared other relevant documentation publicly:
  - The [preregistration](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5727106){target="_blank"}.
  - The [questionnaire itself](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5727057){target="_blank"}, 
  including the information provided to participants.
  - The [final report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5725177){target="_blank"} 
  written about the dataset.

Note that in the metadata of all these publications, cross-references to the 
other publications are included to allow for maximum findability of the 
projectâ€™s outputs.

# Reusing education data for research {#reuse-education-data}

On this page: further processing, secondary use, reuse, student data, education,
legal basis, access control
::::

A research group at the Science faculty wanted to investigate the effects of the 
Covid-19 pandemic on studentsâ€™ motivation and study success in a specific course. 
To do so, they wanted to analyse:

- Studentsâ€™ evaluations of the course from both before and during the pandemic.
- Studentsâ€™ test and final grades in the course from both before and during the pandemic.

The primary researchers already had access to the data for their educational 
activities, and so they wanted to use the data for research purposes. They went 
to their faculty privacy officer to find out how they could reuse these data in 
a responsible way.

The following privacy issues are relevant in this use case:

- **The raw data were identifiable**<br>
The student grades were linked to names, and both the grades and the evaluations 
were linked to student IDs. Moreover, the evaluations could potentially contain 
names of teachers and other personal information, as they consisted of partly 
open-ended questions. To decrease identifiability, the principal investigator and 
a second examiner, who already had access to the studentsâ€™ data, first removed or 
replaced all names with pseudonyms (both names of student and teachers), and went 
through the open-ended questions to remove potentially directly identifiable 
information. Only after deidentification were the data shared with research 
assistants who performed the main data and content analyses.<br><br>
- **Data subjectsâ€™ rights**<br>
Most students had already finished the course, and were not informed about the 
use of their evaluations and grades for this research project. The researchers 
argued that the majority of the students could not be traced anymore to provide 
this information or to enable them to exercise their data subjectsâ€™ rights 
([art. 14(5)(b)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
Moreover, in case a student did want to exercise their rights, it would prove 
difficult to retrieve the correct data, as the data were deidentified as soon as 
possible.<br><br>
- **Legal basis**<br>
Students did not provide explicit consent to process their grades and evaluations 
for this research project. Moreover, if they had provided consent, it could be 
argued that the consent was not freely given, as the primary researchers were 
also involved as teachers, and therefore there was a hierarchical relationship 
between the students and the teachers.  For these reasons, consent was not a 
suitable legal basis in this case. Instead, the researchers relied on:
  - **Public interest**: processing studentsâ€™ data for the course itself is a 
  public task, namely that of providing education. It was the legal basis for 
  the initial data collection.
  - **Further processing for scientific research purposes**: processing data to 
  answer the research question can be considered as secondary use of the 
  studentsâ€™ personal data. The GDPR does not consider secondary use of personal 
  data for scientific research purposes incompatible with the original purpose 
  (i.e., the original purpose being to provide education and improving the 
  course, [art. 5(1)(b)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
  Thus, it was not necessary to rely on a new legal basis for this research 
  project, provided that the data were protected sufficiently: The researchers 
  made sure that the data were well-protected (i.e., minimised, pseudonymised, 
  and access controlled, [art. 89](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-89-gdpr/){target="_blank"}).
