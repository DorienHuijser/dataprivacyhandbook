# Documents & Agreements {#legal-documents}

**This chapter addresses privacy-related documentation that is most commonly used
within research. For each type of documentation, it explains what it entails,
when to use it, and how.**

The following documents are addressed:

- [Privacy notices](#privacy-notices)
- [Informed consent forms](#informed-consent-forms)
- [Privacy scan](#privacy-scan)
- [Data Protection Impact Assessment](#dpia)
- [Data classification](#data-classification)
- [Legitimate interest assessment](#legitimate-interest-assessment)
- [Data Transfer Impact Assessment](#dtia)
- [Several agreements](#agreements), such as the non-disclosure agreement, data processing
agreement, data transfer agreement, joint controller agreement, and data use 
agreement.

**A privacy notice is any information given to data subjects about what is 
happening with their personal data. In research, a privacy notice is usually 
combined with general information about the research project and often with an 
informed consent form, to satisfy both privacy and ethical concerns. Generally, 
the aim of a privacy notice is to inform data subjects on how and why their 
data are being processed. Providing that information is the "cornerstone of 
data subjects’ rights", as without it, data subjects cannot exercise their other 
privacy rights.**

### When to use a privacy notice?
Informing data subjects is always required, for **all [legal bases](#legal-basis)** 
(so not only when you use informed consent). Being properly informed is a data 
subject’s right in itself (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/" target = "_blank">art. 12</a>): 
it is necessary so that data subjects can exercise their [other rights](#data-subject-rights)
(e.g., right to be informed, right to object, etc.). 

You need to inform data subjects **before** you start processing their personal 
data (so before the start of your research project). When you use data from 
another source (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/" target="_blank">art. 14</a>), 
you have to inform your data subjects within a month after obtaining their data. 
If the data are shared with an external party, this can happen at the latest 
when first sharing those data with that external party.

### Content and examples of privacy notices
Below you can find a list of items to include in your information to data 
subjects (Template) and some example sentences to (not) include in your privacy
notice (click to expand).

We will then delete any personal data referring to you that we still have. However, if we somehow processed your data before you withdrew your consent, such processing does not need to be undone.”</td>

### Form of a privacy notice
::::fyi
The format of the privacy notice is also crucial. Even if you include all 
necessary components in your privacy notice, it will **not be GDPR-compliant** 
if you fail to provide the information in an appropriate form, shape and time.
::::

The information you provide to data subjects should also be:

- **Clear and understandable**<br>
A privacy notice is not a legal document, so do not write it like you would 
write a legal contract. The information should be understandable for data 
subjects and it should have a clear and concrete meaning. For example, avoid 
using words like “may”, “some”, “often” and write active and short sentences.

- **Easily accessible**<br>
Data subjects should be able to find the information easily. For example, publish 
the privacy notice on your project website, give participants a copy, or provide 
a QR-code or short URL.

- **Via multiple channels (when appropriate)**<br>
Textual information sheets are by no means the only way to inform data subjects. 
If appropriate, you can provide the information via other channels too, e.g., 
oral statements, images, audio, video 
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5aMCfqw1Lw" target="_blank">example</a>), 
etc. For some data subjects, such other channels of informing can lead to a better 
understanding of your processing activities.

- **Layered (when appropriate)**<br>
To balance being complete with being understandable, you can layer the 
information you provide. For example, provide concise information up front and 
provide more detailed information elsewhere (e.g., via a link or dropdown menu).

If you are uncertain about the level of intelligibility and transparency of the 
information, you can test these, for example through user panels, readability 
testing, or by interactions with data subjects themselves (or their 
representatives).
