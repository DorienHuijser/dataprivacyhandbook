You can only process personal data if you have a **legal basis** to do so, which 
should be registered, among other information, in the 
[processing register](#processing-register) and 
[communicated to data subjects](#privacy-notices). There are 6 possible 
legal bases which are outlined below. In research, the legal bases 'informed 
consent', 'public interest' and to some extent 'legitimate interests of the 
controller' are most often used.

:::fyi
**For different purposes in your research project, a different 
legal basis may apply**. For example, you may contact data subjects before they 
start participating based on a legitimate interest and use informed consent for 
collecting, storing, analysing and publishing the data.

### Legal bases suitable for research

<ol>
  <li>
    <details open="true">
      <summary><b>Informed consent</b></summary>
      <div>Informed consent is the most frequently used legal basis in research and 
        is often not only a legal (GDPR-consent), but also an ethical obligation 
        (e.g., METC informed consent). When using informed consent, you should 
        be able to demonstrate that the data subject was informed and has given 
        consent, and for which purpose(s) they gave their consent. In all cases, 
        consent has to be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. Please 
        refer to the [Informed consent section](#informed-consent-forms) for 
        guidance on applying informed consent in your research.</div>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Public interest</b></summary>
      <div><p>
        Public interest is sometimes used in research when the research is shown
        to clearly benefit the public good or fulfills a public task. In 
        essence, public interest can be used for research that is conducted by 
        employees of public institutions, when their research interest has been 
        recognised by an official authority. For example, conducting research at 
        Dutch universities has been officially recognised in the 
        [Higher Education and Scientific Research Act](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/2022-01-01){target="_blank"}
        to be a public task. Public interest is often used when consent is not 
        a good option. For example, it may be impossible or impractical to 
        obtain consent when performing public observations or social media 
        research. Or when participants actually do not have a free choice, such 
        as in clinical trials when participants would experience significant 
        disadvantages when not participating.
      </p><p>If you want to use public interest as a legal basis, you 
        need to assess the necessity and proportionality of your processing. 
        Additionally, you need to demonstrate that the interests of data 
        subjects do not override your research interests. To do so, please contact 
        your [privacy officer](#support) to assess whether you can use this 
        legal basis in your research.</p></div>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Legitimate interest of the controller</b></summary>
      <div><p>
        Legitimate interest is often used by companies to process personal data 
        necessary for the functioning of their own company, e.g., processing 
        user data for fraud prevention, or keeping a registration system to 
        provide better services. In research, legitimate interest is often used 
        for processing activities that have no direct research purpose. For 
        example, this can be the case when you need to collect contact 
        information to approach data subjects to participate, and you can only 
        obtain their consent for participating in your research after contacting 
        them. Since contacting data subjects is a prerequisite to perform your 
        research, it can be in the university's legitimate (research) interest 
        to process their contact information.
      </p><p>To evaluate whether you can use legitimate interest as a legal basis, you 
        always need to weigh the interests of the controller (e.g., Utrecht 
        University) and the data subjects in a 
        [Legitimate interest assessment](#legitimate-interest-assessment).
        Please contact your [privacy officer](#support) to assess whether you 
        can use this legal basis in your research.</p></div>

### Legal bases not suitable for reseach

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Processing is necessary because of a legal obligation of the controller</b></summary>
      <div>This basis is not suitable for research. As an example, Utrecht 
        University has to share tax data with the Dutch tax administration in 
        order to comply with tax legislation.</div>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract</b></summary>
      <div>This basis is not suitable for research. As an example, Utrecht 
        University has contracts with its employees, which require it to manage 
        the employees' financial data.</div>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Processing is necessary to protect a person's vital interests</b></summary>
      <div>This basis is generally not suitable for research. If processing 
        someone's personal data is crucial to their health or even life, that 
        processing is allowed under the GDPR.</div>
    </details>
  </li>
</ol>


### Further processing for research purposes {#further-processing}

It may happen that you want to process personal data for other purposes than 
previously specified (e.g., because you formulated an additional research 
question), or you want to reuse previously collected personal data in your 
research. In these cases, it may be possible to make use of 
[article 5(1)(b)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/){target="_blank"}, 
which states that "further processing for [...] scientific purposes shall [...] 
not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes". Basically, this 
means that you can reuse personal data, that were previously collected for other 
purposes, for scientific research purposes. This is only allowed if you put in 
place sufficient safeguards to protect the personal data, inform data subjects, 
and allow them to exercise their rights 
([art. 89](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-89-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
"Further processing" is not strictly a legal basis. Instead, it functions as a 
way to legitimise *further* processing of personal data (which was previously 
collected for a different purpose, using one of the six legal bases) for research 
purposes.

:::note
Public interest, legitimate interest, and relying on further processing are ways 
to meet your *legal* requirements for processing personal data, but not 
necessarily your *ethical* requirements: you may still need consent if demanded 
so from an ethical perspective. Before you rely on any of these, you should 
first assess whether they are indeed suitable with your faculty [privacy officer](#support), 
and determine whether your research interests outweigh the privacy rights of 
the data subjects.

**Of the 6 possible legal bases to process personal data, informed consent is 
currently the one most often used in research. With the term consent, we mean 
the process of data subjects deciding whether or not to agree to specific 
statements, such as a statement to participate in a research project.**

### Consent step-by-step {#consent-step-by-step}

1. <details><summary>Determine if consent is the legal basis you need</summary>
<div><p>Determine if consent is the [legal basis](#legal-basis) you need for your
      research: there are other legal bases besides consent which can sometimes be 
      more suitable in a research context.</p>
      <p>In some situations, consent is likely the only way to process data, for 
      example, if you want to process 
      [special categories of personal data]{#special-types-personal-data}, 
      or if you process personal data from people who are incapable of giving consent
      or from children under 16 years old. In the latter 
      case, the GDPR requires to obtain additional obtain consent from a legal 
      representative (e.g., parent), and there are additional requirements when your 
      research falls under the Dutch 
      [Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act](https://www.ccmo.nl/onderzoekers/aanvullende-informatie-over-bepaalde-soorten-onderzoek/onderzoek-bij-proefpersonen-jonger-dan-16-jaar-kinderen/toestemming){target="_blank"}.</p>
</div></details>
2. <details><summary>Consider if you meet all requirements for consent</summary>
  <div>If you need to use consent as a legal basis, consider if you meet 
  [all requirements listed below](#consent-requirements). If you do not,
  consent is not a valid legal basis, and you should consider another one.
  </div></details>
3. <details><summary>Determine what you will ask consent for</summary>
  <div>Determine what specifically you are asking consent for. If you cannot 
  determine a specific purpose, for instance because your research question is 
  not yet entirely clear, contact your [privacy officer](#support)
  to consider [obtaining broad consent](#broad-consent).
  </div></details>
4. <details><summary>Prepare information for data subjects</summary>
  <div>Prepare a 
  [privacy notice or information letter](#privacy-notices) 
  for data subjects to inform them before asking for their consent.
  </div></details>
5. <details><summary>Obtain demonstrable consent</summary>
  <div>Different [forms of consent](#forms-consent) are valid. Note 
  that often a [signature is not required](#to-sign-or-not-to-sign).
  </div></details>
6. <details><summary>Keep the consent forms available</summary>
  <div>Treat the consent declarations as personal data: 
  [store them](#demonstrate-consent) separately and securely from the 
  research data, and for as long as your research data contain personal data. 
  </div></details>

:::note
Note that the term “consent” is used both in the GDPR as well as in an ethical 
context. As a [legal basis](#legal-basis), data subjects give consent 
to process their personal data (e.g., "I consent to my data a, b, c be used for 
purpose x, y, z"). In an ethical context, consent is a 
[safeguard](https://edps.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publication/20-01-06_opinion_research_en.pdf#page=20){target="_blank"}
to give data subjects more control over their personal data, and makes sure they 
participate voluntarily in the research project (e.g.,  "I have read the 
information and agree to participate under the conditions described"). Thus, it 
can happen that consent is not be the best legal basis to use, but should still 
be used as an ethical requirement.
:::

### Requirements for valid consent {#consent-requirements}

Under the GDPR, consent is only valid when it is **all** of the below
([art. 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/){target="_blank"}, 
[art. 7](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/){target="_blank"}, 
[rec. 32](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-32/){target="_blank"}, 
[rec. 42](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-42/){target="_blank"}, 
[rec. 43](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-43/){target="_blank"}; 
click to expand):

<ul>
  <li><details><summary>Freely given</summary>
  <div>Data subjects should have an actual voluntary choice and should not experience 
  negative consequences if they don’t consent or withdraw their consent. Moreover, 
  they should not be pressured to provide consent, and so there cannot be a power 
  imbalance between the controller (e.g., researcher) and data subjects 
  ([rec. 43](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-43/){target="_blank"}).<br><br>
  Some examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Consent is not a valid legal basis when the researcher is also a 
      teacher and asks their students to participate, who depend on the teacher 
      for a good grade.</li>
      <li>Consent in a clinical trial is not a valid legal basis when patients 
      are asked to participate in the trial, but the choice to participate 
      affects their treatment plan or treatment outcome.</li>
      <li>Consent can still be used for children and persons legally incapable to 
      provide consent when their legal representative(s) provide the consent.</li>
    </ul>
  </div></details></li>
  <li><details><summary>Specific</summary>
  <div>Data subjects should know as specifically as possible what they are asked to
  consent to. Separate processing purposes therefore require explicitly separate 
  consent ([rec. 32](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-32/){target="_blank"}, 
  [rec. 43](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-43/){target="_blank"}), and 
  accompanying specific information that will allow the data subjects to decide 
  if they consent or not. If consents for multiple purposes are necessary for your 
  research, you can combine those.<br><br>
  Some examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Combined consent may be possible to collect, store, analyse, and share 
     personal data with your collaborators – all actions are needed to answer your 
     research question.</li>
     <li>Separate consent is needed for conducting a survey vs. for conducting a 
     subsequent interview, if participation in that interview is not required for 
     your research project.</li>
     <li>Separate consent is needed for the current research project vs. for contacting 
     data subjects for future research projects.</li>
     <li>Separate consent is needed to use personal data to answer a research question 
     vs. to link different sources of data together to do so 
     ([Code of Conduct Dutch Health Research, 2022](https://www.coreon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Code-of-Conduct-for-Health-Research-2022.pdf){target="_blank"}.</li>
     <li>Separate consent is recommended to make the personal data 
     [available for reuse](#data-sharing-reuse) (describe the 
     conditions under which this will be allowed).</li>
    </ul>
  </div></details></li>
  <li><details><summary>Informed</summary>
  <div>Data subjects need to be clearly and accessibly informed about which personal 
  data are processed and why, and about their rights (see 
  [Information to data subjects](#privacy-notices)). Data subjects should be 
  able to access this information easily (also after they have provided 
  consent).</div></details>
  </li>
  <li><details><summary>Unambiguous and affirmative</summary>
  <div>It should be clear what data subjects are providing consent for, using 
  a clear, affirmative statement. Importantly, "silence, pre-ticked boxes or 
  inactivity" do not constitute valid consent 
  ([rec. 32](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-32/){target="_blank"}): 
  consent should be active.
  </div></details>
  </li>
  <li><details><summary>Retractable</summary>
  <div>Data subjects have the 
  [right to withdraw their consent](#data-subject-rights), meaning 
  their personal data cannot be used for the research purpose anymore and have to 
  be removed where possible. Withdrawing consent should be as easy as providing 
  consent. It is important to make the distinction with the right to stop 
  participating at any time (usually an ethical obligation), because the latter 
  implies that the data collected up until that point can still be used for the 
  research project.</div></details>
  </li>
</ul>

### What forms of consent are valid? {#forms-consent}

The way you obtain consent may differ per research project and can depend on 
how you interact with your data subjects. The only requirement is that it should 
be demonstrable and registered in a reliable manner. Some examples:

- Ticking a box (**not** pre-ticked!)
- Writing or replying to an email (“I agree to be interviewed”)
- Filling in an electronic form
- Audio- or video-recorded consent (separate it from the research data!)
- Signing a paper document (not usually necessary)

#### To sign or not to sign?

Signatures in consent forms are rarely needed. In fact, if you are only 
processing *pseudonymised* research data, you will only collect unnecessary 
personal data by obtaining a signature 
([art. 11](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/){target="_blank"}), and a 
checkbox should be sufficient. In order to link the consent form with the data 
subject, you should include the pseudonym on the consent form (the identifier 
you will use for the participant, e.g., “part-001”). Inform your participants 
of this pseudonym; they can use it to exercise their rights under the GDPR, 
such as for withdrawing their consent. 

Only when the identity of the data subjects will be used in the process (e.g., 
clinical trials), a signature may make sense or be required. For example, if 
your research is 
[subject](https://english.ccmo.nl/investigators/legal-framework-for-medical-scientific-research/your-research-is-it-subject-to-the-wmo-or-not){target="_blank"} 
to the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO), 
[different requirements may apply](https://www.ccmo.nl/onderzoekers/wet-en-regelgeving-voor-medisch-wetenschappelijk-onderzoek/de-wmo-in-een-notendop/toestemming/elektronische-toestemming){target="_blank"}.

### Demonstrating (valid) consent {#demonstrate-consent}

As long as you process personal data, you should be able to demonstrate that the 
data subjects consented to that processing 
([rec. 42](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-42/){target="_blank"}). 
So as long as you analyse, use, store, archive, etc. the personal data, the 
proof of consent needs to be retained. It is preferable to store the proofs 
separately from the research data. If you collected consent on paper, it is 
best practice to scan the consent forms and securely delete the paper version 
after having made sure the scanning went well. Only after there is no personal 
data anymore (e.g., after fully anonymising the dataset), you can remove the 
proof of consent. 

### Broad consent in research {#broad-consent}

In research, it can sometimes be difficult to formulate very specific research 
questions in advance. In this case, you may be able to formulate the research 
purposes on a more general level and obtain consent for these more general 
purposes 
([EDPS, 2020](https://edps.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publication/20-01-06_opinion_research_en.pdf){target="_blank"}; 
[Deutsche Datenschutzkonferenz, 2019](https://www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/media/dskb/20190405_auslegung_bestimmte_bereiche_wiss_forschung.pdf){target="_blank"}).
However, you can do this only as long as:

- data subjects can give consent to only part of the research and easily 
withdraw consent 
([rec. 33](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-33/){target="_blank"}).
- data subjects are kept informed as specifically as possible about what will 
happen to their personal data. As soon as you know more, you should also inform 
data subjects in more detail. Your use of the personal data should fall within
the line of expectation from data subjects.
- you use additional protection measures, for example:
  - obtain ethical approval for using the data for new research questions.
  - offer a consent withdrawal possibility before using the data for new research 
 questions. This is especially relevant when it is still possible to reliably 
 identify data subjects in the dataset.
  - make sure the data are not transferred to countries outside of the EEA, 
 unless one of the derogations from GDPR 
 [Chapter V](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-5/){target="_blank"} 
 applies (e.g., adequacy decision, standard contractual clauses, explicit 
 consent for transfer).
  - enforce specific requirements for access the data, e.g., "research in general" 
 is not a sufficiently specific purpose for reuse of the personal data.
- you document your considerations and ask for help from a [privacy officer](#support).

:::note
Broad consent under the GDPR needs to be distinguished from "General consent" 
as defined by the Dutch
[Code of Conduct for health researchers](https://www.coreon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Code-of-Conduct-for-Health-Research-2022.pdf){target="_blank"}, 
that is: for medical research, different requirements may (additionally) apply.

:::

If you plan to use legitimate interest as a [legal basis](#legal-basis) in your 
research project, the GDPR requires that you assess the balance between your 
interests and those of your data subjects 
([art. 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). In such an 
assessment, you consider:

- the purpose of your research: what is your interest? The interest (purpose) 
must be real, concrete and direct. In research, enabling you to perform your 
research is usually a legitimate purpose.
- whether your processing is:
  - necessary: can you reasonably achieve your goal in a more privacy-friendly 
  way?, and
  - proportionate: how many people will be affected, to what extent and how 
  intrusive is your processing?
- your interests vs. those of data subjects (balancing test), e.g., can data 
subjects expect you to process their data this way, what is the impact of your 
processing on data subjects, your project, and society, and which safeguards can 
you put in place to protect data subjects’ interests? 

### How to do a legitimate interest assessment? {#lia-how}

Assessing the legitimacy of your processing is part of the 
[privacy scan](#privacy-scan) or, if applicable, a [DPIA](#dpia). If you do not 
use a privacy scan or DPIA and/or you have not performed this assessment (yet), 
but you do rely on legitimate interest, please contact your 
[privacy officer](#support) as soon as possible to perform a privacy scan anyways.

::::note
Please note: once your interest is assessed as being "legitimate", this is not 
a free pass to do whatever you want with the data: you still need to incorporate 
[Privacy by design](#privacy-by-design) into your project, for example by 
adequately informing data subjects, protecting the personal data, and allowing 
data subjects to exercise their rights.
